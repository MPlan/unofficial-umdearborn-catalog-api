In this course students will review basic neoclassical economic theory and learn to apply it to the analysis of public policy issues. Economics offers important insights into the behavior of businesses, consumers, and government entities. We will review key economic concepts, applying each to an array of public policy questions. Next we'll evaluate resource allocation via the market system and consider how public policy might address situations where the market fails to produce desirable results. Lastly, we'll learn about the basic tools economists use to evaluate pubic policies.

 This course explores the history and aesthetics of Black sacred music within cultural context. Major figures (Thomas A. Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson, The Winans Family, Kirk Franklin), periods (slavery, Great Migration, Civil Rights movement), and styles (folk and arranged Negro spirituals, congregational songs, and gospel songs - traditional to contemporary) will be studied through recording, videos, film, and at least one field experience. Underlying the course is the theory (Mellonee Burnim and Pearl Williams-Jones) that gospel music is an expression of African American culture that fuses both African and European elements into a unique whole.

Women have often been regarded as the second sex of the middle ages due to the misogynistic attitudes of that era. Recent scholarship, however, has unearthed a significantly more complex picture. Through a study of visual representations of women in medieval art, this course will examine women's roles in the creation and patronage of art and literature, economic and family issues, and women's participation in new and innovative forms of religious piety.

 Will compare several Islamic movements in Middle Eastern history, starting with the rise of Islam in Mecca and Medina. Later impulses toward Islamic revival all looked back to the first movement, and hoped to capture both its spirit and its success. With this as background, the course will move to address two questions; How did later Islamic movements understand the history of the rise of Islam? How have later Islamic movements had to adapt their methods and their ideology to different historical circumstances? (AY).

 A study of archetypal figures and thematic motifs. Their recurrent appearance in different literary periods and genres and their lineage will be examined in order to increase understanding of the works themselves and of the ages which produced them. A selection will be made from classical myth, Biblical narrative, and historical sources. Thus the figures may vary from Oedipus and Cain to Faust and Don Juan. Motifs or story patterns may include such devices as the spiritual quest, the journey into Hell, or the patricide prophecy.

This course examines how religion and spirituality as cultural form has been instrumental in influencing social, political, and economic thought and the action of violent and nonviolent resistance. In such, African Americans have affirmed their humanity, their citizenship, and have exerted mechanisms of protest and change that have in-kind influenced similar thought and activity around the globe. When contemporary students are aware of this history at all, it is often without the knowledge or understanding of the various forms of resistance and the range of reason and spirituality behind this activity. The course will present key figures from within this range (AY).

In this course we will try to examine the historical circumstances and contexts surrounding the writing of The Hebrew Bible. Roughly speaking, we will begin by exploring three aspects of the subject: Historical context of the writing of the Bible-i.e. during the organizing and communicating of each segment. History of the canonization: the ideas and rationale behind including some books but not others. History in the Bible. In more specific terms, this will entail examining who wrote the Bible, when and why. The narrative incorporates the movement from an oral tradition to a written one and will demand some focus on certain pivotal moments, e.g., Ezra's reading (cf. Ezra-Nehemiah), or the historical events in Kings and Chronicles, or the defeat of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 B.C.E. (BC) and of the southern kingdom of Judah in 589 B.C.E.

A study of both the history of, and current issues in, the philosophy of technology. This course will examine the deeper meaning and implications of our modern technological society. Questions examined include: What is the definition and nature of technology? How did the concept originate in Western thought? What is the relationship between modern industrial technology and the 'mechanistic' worldview? How do Western religious beliefs influence our attitudes about technology? Is technological progress socially determined, or is it culturally independent? In what ways has our technological society been supportive of, or detrimental to, overall human well-being? Students will cover both classic and contemporary readings.

Using the biography of Henry Ford as a touchstone, the course will examine the trajectories of historical change and regional development between 1870 and 1950. Of fundamental concern will be southeastern Michigan's transformation from a 19th century outpost on the Great Lakes to the nation's "engine of change" in the 20th century. Henry Ford was the major player in that revolutionary transformation. This course examines his role in history and mythology as well as the causes and implications of that transformation. (OC).

This course examines the development of urban America from the European-style port cities of the colonial period through the edge cities of today. The bulk of the course will focus on the late 19th and 20th century urban environment with an eye towards understanding the diverse residents, cultures, economies, and geographies that have shaped the American cities. We will cover everything from developments in transportation, architecture, business, and technology to immigration, politics, and urban culture. Broad concerns and constituencies have shaped the urban public sphere, the physical development of cities and the experiences of living as an urbanite and, consequently, they will receive much of our attention. American patterns of development will then be placed in context with those of other nations and cultures.

Darwinism represents a challenge to the traditional view of human life as radically separate from the rest of the natural world. This course will examine the philosophical implications of this world view. It will address questions such as these: Is Darwinism compatible with traditional religion? Does Darwinism imply that human life and the cosmos are without purpose? Can human life be meaningful if it is the result of evolution and natural selection? Does Darwinism require us to change our view of nature? What are the ethical implications of a Darwinian view of life and the universe? (OC).

Full Title: Sem in Detroit: Community Organizing for Environmental Justice.
This course serves as an elective course for the Semester in Detroit (SiD) program. This course looks at movements, resistance, resilience, and liberation as it pertains to environmental justice. A growing body of evidence reveals that people of color and low-income persons have borne greater environmental and health risks than the society at large in their neighborhood, workplace, and playgrounds. We will connect history, current events, and real-life experiences to local organizing and movement struggles that build power for our communities. We will utilize highly interactive popular education methods where participants share political analysis, learn facilitation and organizing skills, and think together about long-term, transformative strategies to build environmental, racial and economic justice.

Social workers often have to engage clients who would are reluctant to engage with service providers. Often this group includes those who are mandated to engage with service due to legal requirements (for example, substance users and those convicted of domestic violence) however the initiation of service may experience reluctance as well (for example bridge cards and temporary shelter). This course examines the strategies and theories for interventions with reluctant clients and the various populations afflicted. The legalities and ethics of coercive service provision are outlined. Systems reform and enhancement for these clients, programs and services is reviewed in current literatures.

This course explores intersections of religion, spirituality, and faith with sexuality and gender. Christianity and Islam receive particular attention. We also examine Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) journeys within Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, new spiritual movements, and interfaith work. The course highlights intersections at three levels of analysis: the individual or personal level (how do LGBTQ identities intersect and interact with religious freedom and practice?), the interactional or community level (how do LGBTQ people experience belonging and rejection in diverse faith communities?) and the institutional level (how do the structures of these belief systems shape the life chances of LGBTQ people in society?).

Have you ever been dissed? Why are some people targets of disrespect? This class examines the unequal distribution of power - social, economic, and political - in the United States and other countries that results in favor for privileged groups. We will examine a variety of institutional practices and individual beliefs that contribute to disrespect. We'll look at ways that beliefs and practices, like viewing inequality as consequence of a 'natural order', obscure the processes that create and sustain social discrimination. We will engage in the intellectual examination of systems, behaviors, and ideologies that maintain discrimination and the unequal distribution of power and resources. Students will not receive credit for both SOC 404 and SOC 504.

 This course will offer an overview of sexual differences including: the socio-cultural construction of gender, sexual behavior, and orientation; sex and sexualities in language and literature; and diversity by race, class, and cultural heritage.  These topics will enable students to understand human sexuality within and across a continuum removing notions of duality, or polarity, in sexual behaviors and orientations.  Examples both from within Western society and from non-Western societies may be used to further this position.  Theoretical perspectives may encompass sociological and anthropological work, literary theory and criticism, queer theory, and multi-disciplinary discussions/discourse. Texts may include: Sex and the Machine: Readings in Culture, Gender and Technology, The Anatomy of Love, The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader, Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transexuality, and Lesbian and Gay Marriage.

Qualitative research methods involve the observation and study of people in their everyday lives, in their taken-for-granted worlds. Qualitative research seeks to combine close empirical observation with analytic techniques that demand (and teach) personal and social self-consciousness as necessary to an understanding of the social worlds of ?others?. This course in qualitative methods is designed to acquaint students with field research theories and techniques. Students will gain hands on experience in participant observation, interviewing and the use of sociological scholarship. Qualitative Research Methods will prepare students to gather data, focus the data in a social scientific manner, analyze the data, and then organize it in reportable form.

Course begins with a review of the sociological literature on the professions. It will then focus on the medical, legal, and business/managerial professions as case studies of the development of professions in post-industrial society.

 Social changes in America are studied from an internal and an external perspective. The internal dynamics of social change emphasize the role of social movement, e.g., the impact of the civil rights movement on American culture and politics.

Diversity Issues in Mental Health explores varied cultural descriptions and models of mental illness. By focusing on the ways that culture shapes how people experience, and respond to, mental illness this class explores cultural representations of mental illness, ranging from discrete illness resulting from a chemical imbalance to a profound threat to order. We seek to understand the cultural, personal, and political underpinnings of mental illness and medical practices in societies throughout the world. The course utilizes an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing from multiple sources of information regarding mental health issues, including feminism, psychiatry, history, sociology, and literature. Issues raised throughout the course include the ways gender, race, culture, religion, and stigma influence the diagnosis of mental illness, patterns of help-seeking behavior, formation of comprehensive mental health policy, and treatment options.

This community-based course, taught in a local correctional facility, brings university students and incarcerated students together to study as peers. Together students explore issues of crime and justice, drawing on one another to create a deeper understanding of how these issues affect our lives as individuals and as a society. The course creates a dynamic partnership between UMD and a correctional facility to allow students to question approaches to issues of crime and justice in order to build a safer and more just society for all. The course encourages outside (UMD) students to contextualize and to think deeply about what they have learned about crime and criminals and to help them pursue the work of creating a restorative criminal justice system; it challenges inside students to place their life experiences into larger social contexts and to rekindle their intellectual self-confidence and interest in further education.

 Mass media, politics, and academia are full of references to globalization, and a future "world without borders." This interdisciplinary course considers the implication of globalization for women's lives, gender relations, and feminism. Topics covered include the global factory, cross-cultural consumption, human rights, global communications, economic restructuring, nationalism, and environmental challenges. Rather than survey international women's movements, this course explores how globalization reformulates identities and locations and the political possibilities they create. (AY).

Course examines local and global social violence against women outside family and other intimate relationships. Students consider violations against women's human rights through the life cycle, which are often sanctioned under the guise of cultural practices and misinterpretations of religious tenets. Topics include sex-selective abortion and female infanticide (the "missing millions"); female genital mutilation and cosmetic surgeries; prostitution and pornography; trafficking in women; sexual harassment; and women's experiences of war as soldiers, non-combatants and refugees. Topics are "paired", that is, students compare understandings of Western and non-Western social practices related to gender. Students examine both institutionalized sexism and racism, as part of political, economic, and social systems, and sexism and racism as realities affecting individual women's lives.

TOPIC: Diasporas and (Trans) Nationalism: Gender, Race, and Post/Coloniality. An interdisciplinary and comparative inquiry into historical &amp; contemporary linkages between gender regimes, national formations, and legacies of colonialism as they interact at "home" and in "diasporas." Using multi-media and multi-genre pedagogical tools (conceptual and methodological writings; narratives and biographies; guest lectures; films), we study &amp; critique different perspectives on how the dialectics of geography, positionality, and social structures shape the ways in which we imagine "home", "homeland", and "back home." We examine gendered politics of the colonial project 1) in early days of colonialization; 2) during struggles of decolonization; and 3) "post-colonial" geographies' While becoming familiar with "classics" in nationalism/transnationalism, gender, colonialism, and diaspora, we will explore their applicability to specific case studies in European and American contexts as well as in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Have you ever been dissed? Why are some people targets of disrespect? This class examines the unequal distribution of power - social, economic, and political - in the United States and other countries that results in favor for privileged groups. We will examine a variety of institutional practices and individual beliefs that contribute to disrespect. We'll look at ways that beliefs and practices, like viewing inequality as consequence of a 'natural order', obscure the processes that create and sustain social discrimination. We will engage in the intellectual examination of systems, behaviors, and ideologies that maintain discrimination and the unequal distribution of power and resources. Students will not receive credit for both SOC 404 and SOC 504. This course is distinguished from its 400-level counterpart by the requirement of additional assignments, including a required additional paper.

This course examines the different perspectives that feminist theorists have offered to analyze the unequal conditions of women's and men's lives. Students taking this course will develop an understanding of how theory functions as a way to know, understand and change the world. They will also be provided with a lens for comparing the assumptions and implications of alternative theoretical perspectives. A particular emphasis of this course is on theorizing the interrelationships among gender, race, class, sexuality and nationality. Course material includes applications of feminist theory to issues such as gender identity formation; sexuality; gender, law and citizenship; women and work; and the history and politics of social movements. Students will not receive credit for both SOC 409 and SOC 509. Additional reading assignments or projects will distinguish this course from its undergraduate version.

 Social studies in America are studied from an internal and an external perspective. The internal dynamics of social change emphasize the role of social movements, e.g. the impact of the civil rights movement on American culture and politics. The external perspective sees America as part of a changing global society. The development of the capitalist world system from its origins in Western Europe to its present global reach is examined. Contemporary American social problems are examined in relation to America's position in a rapidly changing world. Additional reading assignments or projects will distinguish this course from its undergraduate version SOC 460. Students cannot receive credit for both SOC 460 and SOC 560. (OC)

Mass media, politics, and academia are full of references to globalization, and a future "world without borders." This interdisciplinary course considers the implication of globalization for women's lives, gender relations, and feminism. Topics covered include the global factory, cross-cultural consumption, human rights, global communications, economic restructuring, nationalism, and environmental challenges. Rather than survey international women's movements, this course explores how globalization reformulates identities and locations and the political possibilities they create.

TOPIC: Diasporas and (Trans) Nationalism: Gender, Race, and Post/Coloniality. An interdisciplinary and comparative inquiry into historical &amp; contemporary linkages between gender regimes, national formations, and legacies of colonialism as they interact at "home" and in "diasporas." Using multi-media and multi-genre pedagogical tools (conceptual and methodological writings; narratives and biographies; guest lectures; films), we study &amp; critique different perspectives on how the dialectics of geography, positionality, and social structures shape the ways in which we imagine "home", "homeland", and "back home." We examine gendered politics of the colonial project 1) in early days of colonialization; 2) during struggles of decolonization; and 3) "post-colonial" geographies' While becoming familiar with "classics" in nationalism/transnationalism, gender, colonialism, and diaspora, we will explore their applicability to specific case studies in European and American contexts as well as in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Spanish 465 provides students with an overview of Contemporary Spanish Peninsular literature and culture through the analysis of narrative texts. Selected readings provide the basis for stylistic and textual analysis. Fostering critical thinking through an analysis of texts is the primary focus of the class. The course specifically examines narrative works that belong to the Spanish literary canon produced after the end of an almost forty year dictatorial regime in 1975. The literary works are deeply rooted in Spain¿s social and cultural history. Consequently, they describe the contemporary socio-political scene in which they were produced and look at the uncertain future of this reborn nation.

WIth increasing availability of data, companies, governments, and nonprofits alike are striving to convert this data into knowledge and insight. This course will provide students with the basic skill set needed to handle such data. The course will focus on three broad areas- inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-word applications. We will discuss data collection, data cleaning and exploratory analysis of data so that students can connect the data to the underlying phenomena and be able to think critically about the conclusions that are drawn from the data analysis. The students will also learn how to write short programs to be able to automate the data analysis process developing an applied understanding of different analytics methods, including linear regression, logistic regression, clustering, data visualization, etc. Most of the material will be taught using real world data.

In this course we will explore the field of urban and regional studies. The scope of readings is inter-disciplinary, spanning the environmental, aesthetic, social, economic, geographic, historical, political and cultural aspects of cities, suburbs and regions. The interrelationship between the spatial organization of a city, patterns of social and economic inequality, delivery of services, the relationship between culture and public space, as well as the processes of urban and regional change will all be considered. Problems such as race and class inequality will also be examined.  Special attention will be given to issues of relevance in the Detroit metropolitan region (e.g. spatial, economic, cultural, political and social impacts of the loss of manufacturing jobs). Students will be introduced to methods of social scientific analysis and will begin to apply those methods to researching urban and regional community groups, enterprises and social movements.

This course serves as a core course for the Semester in Detroit (SiD) program. The primary purpose of this class is to provide a supportive, yet challenging learning space for reflecting on your Detroit internship experiences this semester. There are three main sources of material for this class: you, the internship, and Detroit. While, in theory, each is distinct, in practice, all three are intertwined and interact and affect one another. Your challenge will be learning to see more clearly the interactions among these domains. Students must apply to, and be accepted by, UM-Ann Arbor's Semester in Detroit program to enroll in this course.

This course serves as the core course for the Semester in Detroit (SiD) program. It examines the transformation of Detroit from the late 19th, through the 20th and into the 21st Centuries. Our goal is to identify the main forces and patterns of change in Detroit's past that have shaped the contemporary city you encounter today. Thus, the course is organized chronologically, but we will be exploring the city's history alongside consideration of contemporary social issues, challenges, and debates. Course material will include a range of readings, films, and excursions. Through discussion of this material and in written assignments, the course encourages you to develop your own interpretation of the circumstances, challenges and opportunities currently facing the city. Students must apply to, and be accepted by, UM-Ann Arbor's Semester in Detroit program to enroll in this course. (F,W,S)

This course examines the biological and sociocultural construction of body image in both men and women. We explore such cultural and social practices as nudity, tattooing, piercing, scarification, dietary habits, physical activity and sports performance and their associated myths and realities. We explore how the human body is a terrain of contested meaning within society. The course provides an examination of the causes and consequences of women's poor body image, contemporary and historically. Course materials include case studies from North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Pacific.

Women have often been regarded as the second sex of the middle ages due to the misogynistic attitudes of that era. Recent scholarship, however, has unearthed a significantly more complex picture. Through a study of visual representations of women in medieval art, this course will examine women's roles in the creation and patronage of art and literature, economic and family issues, and women's participation in new and innovative forms of religious piety.

Through a historical survey of female musicians from the Middle Ages to the present day, this course takes a critical look at theories of creativity and professionalism as they relate to female musical production. The course deals with women in European "art music" traditions and also in jazz and poplar music. Social and cultural norms dictating appropriate female involvement with music are examined. The historical approach will serve to reveal ways in which terms such as professionalism and virtuosity have continually shifted and changed in reference to female musical performance. The course challenges students to re-think many of the commonly accepted gender-based descriptions of particular genres and elements of music through listening and musical analysis.

This course centers the often overlooked role of gender and sexuality in the 20th century European mobilizations of state violence such as the Holocaust, Armenian Genocide, and conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. It emphasizes the clashes that occured between gains in gender and sexual rights during the century and projects of state violence that were frequently aimed at dismantling these gains. Attention is paid to the intersection of race, class, religion and gender in the (re)construction of new gender and sexual heiarchies in conflict and post-conflict contexts in the region.

Feminists working in philosophy, most notably in the 19th and 20th centuries, have altered the traditional philosophical canon by first, recovering women philosophers who were essentially erased from the history and secondly, by extending and contributing to the standard questions of philosophy. For example, one central question of philosophy; "What can we know with certainty?" has been transformed through a feminist lens and reinterpreted as "What does one's gender, social location and cultural framework contribute to what one knows?" In this course we will look at the variety of feminist philosophical theories with a focus on epistemology, metaphysics and ethics.

This course explores intersections of religion, spirituality, and faith with sexuality and gender. Christianity and Islam receive particular attention. We also examine LGBTQ journeys within Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, new spiritual movements, and interfaith work. Assignments create room for students to engage faith traditions that are not covered in the course readings. The course highlights intersections at three levels of analysis: the individual or personal level (how do LGBTQ identities intersect and interact with religious freedom and practice?), the interactional or community level (how do LGBTQ people experience belonging and rejection in diverse faith communities?), and the institutional level (how do the structures of these belief systems shape the life chances of LGBTQ people in society?).

This lecture course surveys descriptive and critical literature relevant to the religious and spiritual experience and thought of African diasporic women. Studying religiosity and spirituality among this population helps students understand this influential, culturally-constructed world view of Black women as they engage in a variety of institutions including healthcare, economic activity, the criminal justice system, politics, and social relationships. The course gives particular attention to Black feminist and Womanist literature on these topics. (AY)

This course will focus on the position of women in Germany after WWII and up to and after the unification of East and West Germany. Particular attention will be given to the gendered history of working through the National Socialist past, the division and reconstruction of the two nation-states, and the terrorism in West Germany in the 1970's. Students will examine images of women in films and tie them to the ideologies of gender and status of women in these larger issues of German history. Course readings will be in English. Students wishing to receive German credit for the course must enroll concurrently in GER 380: Praktikum. Students cannot receive credit for both WGST 401 and WGST 501.

Have you ever been dissed? Why are some people targets of disrespect? This class examines the unequal distribution of power - social, economic and political in the United States and other countries that results in favor for privileged groups. We will examine a variety of institutional practices and individual beliefs that contribute to disrespect. We'll look at ways that beliefs and practices, like viewing inequality as consequence of a "natural order," obscure the processes that create and sustain social discrimination. We will engage in the intellectual examination of systems, behaviors and ideologies that maintain discrimination and the unequal distribution of power and resources. Student will not receive credit for both WGST 404 and WGST 504.

This course will offer an overview of sexual differences including: the socio-cultural construction of gender, sexual behavior and orientation; sex and sexualities in language and literature; and diversity by race, class and cultural heritage. These topics will enable students to understand human sexuality within and across a continuum removing notions of duality or polarity, in sexual behaviors and orientations. Examples both from within Western society and from non-Western societies may be used to further this position. Theoretical perspectives may encompass sociological and anthropological work, literary theory and criticism, queer theory, and multi-disciplinary discussions/discourse. Texts may include: Sex and the Machine; Readings in Culture; Gender and Technology; The Anatomy of Love; The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader, Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transexuality, and Lesbian and Gay Marriage.

This course examines the different perspectives that feminist theorists have offered to analyze the unequal conditions of women's and men's lives. Students taking this course will develop an understanding of how theory functions as a way to know, understand and change the world. They will also be provided with a lens for comparing the assumptions and implications of alternative theoretical perspectives. A particular emphasis of this course is on theorizing the interrelationships among gender, race, class, sexuality and nationality. Course material includes applications of feminist theory to issues such as gender identity formation; sexuality; gender, law and citizenship; women and work; and the history and politics of social movements. Students will not receive credit for both WGST 409 and WGST 509. (AY )

This course will be taught in English, and will focus on the influence of Italian literary models for the construction of female literary types as well as female voices in France and Italy from 1300 to about 1600. Italian authors studied include three very influential Florentines, Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, as well as Castiglione and Asiosto. We will read women poets, patrons, prostitutes and queens from Italy and France such as Veronica Gambara, Isabella di Morra, Vittoria Colonna, Christine de Pizan, Louise Labe and Marguerite de Navarre. At issue will be women's roles and women's images in city and court culture during the early modern period and the interaction of their writings with the literary canons of Italy and France.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of reproductive health in the US.  Understanding women’s reproductive health requires consideration of the intersections of gender, race, class, culture, geography, economic status, and nation within a sociopolitical context.  The course introduces students to the historical trends in the regulation of women’s fertility and reproductive health.  Readings draw from a number of different disciplines, including: law, medical studies, history, social sciences, and personal narratives to critically examine the intent and impact of current standards for reproductive health policy and practice.  Topics include: reproductive justice, contraception, pregnancy, reproductive control, and family leave.  Course discussions include a focus on health policy and activism to affect change related to women’s reproductive health, all within a framework of reproductive justice.  A major emphasis is on developing critical thinking skills that can be applied to issues of women’s reproductive health in order to educate and empower students to become proactive healthcare consumers.

The course will focus on several feminist approaches used in understanding the media and attempting to create social change through the media. The role of media in the definition and reproduction of gender-based hierarchies and in the renegotiation of gender boundaries will both be explored. To this end, both mainstream and women's media will be examined. The course will take a multicultural and international perspective, incorporating concerns of class, race, ethnicity and nation as these intersect with the study of gender and media. Mainstream and alternative media will be analyzed through readings, films, case studies, in-class collaborative exercises and longer-term projects. News, entertainment and advertising genres will be examined in a variety of media, such as the printed press, television, video, film and the Internet.

This course will examine works produced by Black women authors, activists, filmmakers and musical performers in order to determine the methods they have incorporated in order to challenge and eradicate the prevailing stereotypes about Black women while advancing their own personal and racial agendas. It will also focus on the extent to which race, gender and class have shaped the creative work of Black women. Students will be required to read, analyze and write their own responses to the works of such firebrands as author Zora Neale Hurston, activist Ida B. Wells, filmmaker Julie Dash and singer Billie Holiday.

This course surveys primarily contemporary literature by writers who identify as gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, transgender, or queer. By studying the self-representation and culturally unique perspective of this emerging canon of writers, students in this course understand the emergence of LGBTQ literary traditions and understand the cultural diversity within these traditions. Students learn to identify the aesthetic qualities (such as camp, performativity, coded subtexts, homoeroticism, and the relationship between creativity and sexuality), and historical, political, and social concerns that characterize LGBTQ literary and cultural production. Topics covered include the struggle for civil rights before and after Stonewall, coming out narratives, the negotiation of homophobic cultures, post-colonial writers, and memoirs of the LGBTQ experience, as well as the historical emergence of sexual categories and the literary critique of heteronormativity. This course counts toward the English discipline diversity requirement. Students cannot receive credit for WGST 471 and WGST/ ENGL 571.

Diversity Issues in Mental Health explores varied cultural descriptions and models of mental illness. By focusing on the ways that culture shapes how people experience, and respond to, mental illness this class explores cultural representations of mental illness, ranging from discrete illness resulting from a chemical imbalance to a profound threat to order. We seek to understand the cultural, personal, and political underpinnings of mental illness and medical practices in societies throughout the world. The course utilizes an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing from multiple sources of information regarding mental health issues, including feminism, psychiatry, history, sociology, and literature. Issues raised throughout the course include the ways gender, race, culture, religion, and stigma influence the diagnosis of mental illness, patterns of help-seeking behavior, formation of comprehensive mental health policy, and treatment options.

This community-based course, taught in a local correctional facility, brings university students and incarcerated students together to study as peers. Together students explore issues of crime and justice, drawing on one another to create a deeper understanding of how these issues affect our lives as individuals and as a society. The course creates a dynamic partnership between UMD and a correctional facility to allow students to question approaches to issues of crime and justice in order to build a safer and more just society for all. The course encourages outside (UMD) students to contextualize and to think deeply about what they have learned about crime and criminals and to help them pursue the work of creating a restorative criminal justice system; it challenges inside students to place their life experiences into larger social contexts and to rekindle their intellectual self-confidence and interest in further education.

This interdisciplinary course considers the implication of globalization for women's lives, gender relations and feminism. Topics covered include the global factory, cross-cultural consumption, human rights, global communications, economic restructuring, nationalism and environmental challenges. Rather than survey international women's movements, this course explores how globalization reformulates identities and locations and the political possibilities they create.

Course examines local and global social violence against women outside family and other intimate relationships. Students consider violations against women's human rights through the life cycle, which are often sanctioned under the guise of cultural practices and misinterpretations of religious tenets. Topics include sex-selective abortion and female infanticide (the "missing millions"); female genital mutilation and cosmetic surgeries; prostitution and pornography; trafficking in women; sexual harassment; and women's experiences of war as soldiers, non-combatants and refugees. Topics are "paired", that is, students compare understandings of Western and non-Western social practices related to gender. Students examine both institutionalized sexism and racism, as part of political, economic, and social systems, and sexism and racism as realities affecting individual women's lives.

This course reads theories of sexuality to analyze how writers since 1600 have imagined printed text to reflect and shape desire, particularly same-sex desire. The course questions how same-sex desire appears in literature written before the theorization of "the Homosexual" in the late nineteenth century as well as how writers imagine sexuality before a hetero/homosexual binary appears. Writers may include contemporary theorists (Sedgwick, Foucault, Butler) as well as novelists (Gaskell and Stoker), playwrights (Kushner and Wycherley), and poets.

This course questions our inheritance of the ?the gothic? as a district literary style that continues to discipline readers? notions of gender and sexual identity. The course argues that by tracing the gothic?s literary history, we may simultaneously witness a history of gender formation. Readings may include English novelists who originated a gothic style in English (Walpole, Radcliffe, Lewis) as well as English and American poets and novelists who have debated as well as resisted the effects of the gothic on readers? (particularly women?s) psychology (Christina Rossetti, Austen, King, Stoker).

This course will focus on the position of women in Germany after WWII and up to and after the unification of East and West Germany. Particular attention will be given to the gendered history of working through the National Socialist past, the division and reconstruction of the two nation-states, and the terrorism in West Germany in the 1970's. Students will examine images of women in films and tie them to the ideologies of gender and status of women in these larger issues of German history. Course readings will be in English. This course will be distinguished from its undergraduate counterpart, WGST 401, by the inclusion of additional readings and assignments.

Have you ever been dissed? Why are some people targets of disrespect? This class examines the unequal distribution of power-social, economic and political in the United States and other countries that results in favor for privileged groups. We will examine a variety of institutional practices and individual beliefs that contribute to disrespect. We'll look at ways that beliefs and practices, like viewing inequality as consequence of a "natural order," obscure the processes that create and sustain social discrimination. We will engage in the intellectual examination of systems, behaviors and ideologies that maintain discrimination and the unequal distribution of power and resources. Student will not receive credit for both WGST 404 and WGST 504. This course is distinguished from its 400-level counterpart by the requirement of additional assignments, including a required additional paper.

This course will offer an overview of sexual differences including: the socio-cultural construction of gender, sexual behavior and orientation; sex and sexualities in language and literature; and diversity by race, class and cultural heritage. These topics will enable students to understand human sexuality within and across a continuum removing notions of duality or polarity, in sexual behaviors and orientations. Examples both from within Western society and from non-Western societies may be used to further this position. Theoretical perspectives may encompass sociological and anthropological work, literary theory and criticism, queer theory, and multi-disciplinary discussions/discourse. Texts may include: Sex and the Machine: Readings in Culture, Gender and Technology, The Anatomy of Love, The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader, Second Skins, The Body of Narratives of Transexuality, and Lesbian and Gay Marriage.

This course examines the different perspectives that feminist theorists have offered to analyze the unequal conditions of women's and men's lives. Students taking this course will develop an understanding of how theory functions as a way to know, understand and change the world. They will also be provided with a lens for comparing the assumptions and implications of alternative theoretical perspectives. A particular emphasis of this course is on theorizing the interrelationships among gender, race, class, sexuality and nationality. Course material includes applications of feminist theory to issues such as gender identity formation; sexuality; gender, law and citizenship; women and work; and the history and politics of social movements. Students will not receive credit for both WGST 409 and WGST 509. Additional reading assignments or projects will distinguish this course from its undergraduate version.

This course examines the evidence for the lives of women in Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquity, from the Bronze Age through the Imperial Period. Special emphasis will be placed on the archaeological evidence, especially works of art which illustrate women's lives and their relationships with men. Documents such as dedicatory and funerary inscriptions, the poetry of Sappho and Sulpicia, and selections from the writings of Homer, Hesiod, Aristotle, Pliny, Juvenal, and other ancient authors, will also be examined critically, particularly in relationship to the works of art.

This course will be taught in English, and will focus on the influence of Italian literary models for the construction of female literary types as well as female voices in France and Italy from 1300 to about 1600. Italian authors studied include three very influential Florentines, Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, as well as Castiglione and Ariosto. We will read women poets, patrons, prostitutes and queens from Italy and France such as Veronica Gambara, Isabella di Morra, Vittoria Colonna, Christine de Pizan, Louise Labe and Marguerite de Navarre. At issue will be women's roles and women's images in city and court culture during the early modern period and the interaction of their writings with the literary canons of Italy and France.

The course will focus on several feminist approaches used in understanding the media and attempting to create social change through the media. The role of media in the definition and reproduction of gender-based hierarchies and in the renegotiation of gender boundaries will both be explored. To this end, both mainstream and women's media will be examined. The course will take a multicultural and international perspective, incorporating concerns of class, race, ethnicity and nation as these intersect with the study of gender and media. Mainstream and alternative media will be analyzed through readings, films, case studies, in-class collaborative exercises and longer term projects. News, entertainment and advertising genres will be examined in a variety of media such as the printed press, television, video film and the Internet.

This course surveys primarily contemporary literature by writers who identify as gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, transgender, or queer. By studying the self-representation and culturally unique perspective of this emerging canon of writers, students in this course understand the emergence of LGBTQ literary traditions and understand the cultural diversity within these traditions. Students learn to identify the aesthetic qualities (such as camp, performativity, coded subtexts, homoeroticism, and the relationship between creativity and sexuality), and historical, political, and social concerns that characterize LGBTQ literary and cultural production. Topics covered include the struggle for civil rights before and after Stonewall, coming out narratives, the negotiation of homophobic cultures, post-colonial writers, and memoirs of the LGBTQ experience, as well as the historical emergence of sexual categories and the literary critique of heteronormativity. This course counts toward the English discipline diversity requirement.

Mass media, politics and academia are full of references to globalization, and a future "world without borders." This interdisciplinary course considers the implication of globalization for women's lives, gender relations and feminism. Topics covered include the global factory, cross-cultural consumption, human rights, global communications, economic restructuring, nationalism and environmental challenges. Rather than survey international women's movements, this course explores how globalization reformulates identities and locations and the political possibilities they create. Students cannot receive credit for both WGST 481 and WGST 581.
