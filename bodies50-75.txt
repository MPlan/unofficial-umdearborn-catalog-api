This course will confront and complicate the following key questions: what does it mean to be an American? What is American culture? Participants in this course will respond to the questions central to the American Studies field by reading and discussing historical, sociological, literary, artistic, material culture, political, economic, and other sources. Students will use this interdisciplinary study to examine the multiple identities of Americans - as determined by factors such as gender, race, class, ethnicity and religion. While emphasizing the diversity of American culture, participants will consider some core values and ideas uniting America both in historical and contemporary society. Students will be invited to seek out and share fresh narratives of the American experience.

 A study of archetypal figures and thematic motifs. Their recurrent appearance in different literary periods and genres and their lineage will be examined in order to increase understanding of the works themselves and of the ages which produced them. A selection will be made from classical myth, Biblical narrative, and historical sources. Thus, the figures may vary from Oedipus and Cain to Faust and Don Juan. Motifs and story patterns may include such devices as the spiritual quest, the journey into Hell, or the patricide prophecy.

This course explores the adaptation of literary texts in a variety of literary genres (poetry, drama, fiction) to other artistic mediums (film, graphic novels/comics, paintings, etc.). Moving beyond limited comparisons of "good" originals and "bad" adaptations, this course focuses on the dialogue among multiple versions of the same story across a range of historical periods, asking how and why adaptations modify their sources in a particular manner. This course addresses the difference between adaptation and appropriation as well as imitation, quotation, allusion, pastiche, and parody.

This course questions the literary techniques and forms the English writers developed between 1660 and 1900 to characterize and imagine London to be a unified community and to counter the growing perception of London as a "monstrous city." This image of "the English-speaking City" as an uncontrollable monster may be explored in writings by Daniel Defoe, Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, Robert Louis Stevenson, Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, and Joseph Conrad.

The course examines the adaption of Shakespeare's play-scripts for the screen. It goes beyond a discussion of the relative merits of plays and their respective film adaptions, examining the complex exchanges between the two artistic mediums (e.g. how stage convention such as soliloquies or off-stage action are adapted to the scree; how early silent films were used to market stage productions, etc.). It will approach the issue of adaption by examining the works of key directors, multiple films of a single play, silent films, foreign lanuage adaptions, mass market and art house films, and films which deal with fictive or actual productions of Shakespeare's plays. Special emphasis will be placed on specific stage productions that are later adapted to films. In this course, students will explore a broad range of responses to and interpretations of Shakespeare's works. This class will stress the idea that each staging is an interpretation of the play, its point of view conditioned by the times, the medium, and the director's vision. (OC)

In Writing for Civic Literacy, students will study how politicians, the media and critical citizens use language to engage with the broader community. Students themselves will learn to use language to become more active, well-informed citizens. They will study rhetorical awareness, audience analysis and persuasive writing techniques and put those lessons to use in community settings. They will perform community service at agencies of their choosing and use those experiences as objects of analysis, researching the social context in which those agencies operate and writing analytically about the agencies. Further, students will synthesize classroom lessons and real-world experience by executing writing tasks for and with the agencies (these tasks might include editorials for the local press, informational webpages and fundraising materials).

This course offers a general introduction to Postcolonial Studies - a field of cultural inquiry that questions how personal identity (specifically race, language and ethnicity) shapes, and is shaped by, the politics of colonization and nationalism. Students will clarify the subject of Postcolonial Studies by examining a variety of cultural and linguistic objects (literature, film, TV-journalism, slave- and middle-passage-narrative, and political manifesto) from a variety of cultural perspectives (Arab American, Anglo-Indian, West African, and Caribbean).

An examination of the functions that writers in English have assigned to literary decadence, libertinism, and aestheticism (or, the study of beauty and "art for art's sake"). We will read writers who identified themselves as libertines as well as writers who represented libertines as we address the Restoration rake (Rochester &amp; Behn), the Regency buck (the Shelleys &amp; DeQuincey), the Victorian dandy (Oscar Wilde, Michael Field, &amp; the Decadents), the modern playboy (Nin, Waugh &amp; Fitzgerald), hippie-swinger (Wolfe &amp; Jagger), and finally, the postmodern player-celebrity (Bret Easton Ellis, Will Self &amp; rock-lyricists).

An exploration of satirical writing and its functions from its English origins in eighteenth-century London (Montagu, Swift, Pope) to its twenty-first-century reincarnations in both America and Britain (Zadie Smith, Burgess, Schulyer, Hughes, Waugh). The course emphasizes the various goals that writers have assigned to satire, especially in terms of race, gender, and nationalism.

In this course participants will explore the young adult novel from the point-of-view of a reader and a writer. They will read recently published and critically acclaimed popular young adult novels. They will use these texts to explore such issues as gender, race and identity as they relate to young adult lives and their respective cultures generally. They will use these texts as models for the production of their own texts and will consider the constraints and benefits of constructing and writing to a particular audience. They will consider if and why young adult novels are abbreviated or limited in relationship to adult literature. In addition to reading about ten novels, they will complete several creative exercises leading up to a final portfolio. Students will not receive credit for both ENGL 468 ad ENGL 568.

This course will examine works produced by Black women authors, activists, filmmakers and musical performers in order to determine the methods they have incorporated in order to challenge and eradicate the prevailing stereotypes about Black women while advancing their own personal and racial agendas. It will also focus on the extent to which race, gender and class have shaped the creative work of Black women. Students will be required to read, discuss, analyze and write their own responses to the works of such firebrands as author Zora Neale Hurston, activist Ida B. Wells, filmmaker Julie Dash, and singer Billie Holliday.

This course surveys primarily contemporary literature by writers who identify as gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, transgender, or queer. By studying the self-representation and culturally unique perspective of this emerging canon of writers, students in this course understand the emergence of LGBTQ literary traditions and understand the cultural diversity within these traditions. Students learn to identify the aesthetic qualities (such as camp, performativity, coded subtexts, homoeroticism, and the relationship between creativity and sexuality), and historical, political, and social concerns that characterize LGBTQ literary and cultural production. Topics covered include the struggle for civil rights before and after Stonewall, coming out narratives, the negotiation of homophobic cultures, post-colonial writers, and memoirs of the LGBTQ experience, as well as the historical emergence of sexual categories and the literary critique of heteronormativity. This course counts toward the English discipline diversity requirement. Students cannot receive credit for ENGL 471 and ENGL/WGST 571.

Examines the literary and cultural contributions of Arab and Arab American women novelists, poets and artists to the development and consolidation of the cultures of understanding and coexistence; explores the tensions between citizenship and belonging, race and the politics of fears, gender and geographical mobility, and ethnic minorities and mainstream consciousness; discerns how Arab women writers and artists retool their various artistic endeavors to channel socio-political disenchantment, critique and civil disobedience; stresses how literary and artistic productions of a heterogeneous number of Arab American women writers and artists can indeed foster alternative visions of socio-cultural coexistence, dialogue and hospitality via artistic commitments to technical and stylistic experimentation and renovation. Students cannot receive credit for both ENGL 473 and ENGL 473. For graduate credit take ENGL 573.

A survey of fundamental concepts and major concerns in the study of English as a Second Language (ESL). The course examines a variety of psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic issues related to second language acquisition (SLA), ranging from theoretical to pedagogical. A primary focus is on developmental patterns and cognitive processes of SLA and individual variation in ESL speakers in terms of their social motivations and learning strategies. Implications for practical concerns such as the ESL teaching profession, instructional materials and curriculum development will be addressed where relevant.

This course reads theories of sexuality to analyze how writers since 1600 have imagined printed text to reflect and shape desire, particularly same-sex desire. The course questions how same-sex desire appears in literature written before the theorization of "the Homosexual" in the late nineteenth century as well as how writers imagine sexuality before a hetero/homosexual binary appears. Writers may include contemporary theorists (Sedgwick, Foucault, Butler) as well as novelists (Gaskell and Stoker), playwrights (Kushner and Wycherley), and poets.

This course questions our inheritance of "the gothic" as a district literary style that continues to discipline readers' notions of gender and sexual identity. The course argues that by tracing the gothic's literary history, we may simultaneously witness a history of gender formation. Readings may include English novelists who originated a gothic style in English (Walpole, Radcliffe, Lewis) as well as English and American poets and novelists who have debated as well as resisted the effects of the gothic on readers' (particularly women's) psychology (Christina Rossetti, Austen, King, Stoker).

In this course participants will explore the young adult novel form the point-of-view of a reader and a writer. They will read recently published and critically acclaimed popular young adult novels. They will use these texts to explore such issues as gender, race and identity as they relate to young adult lives and their respective cultures generally. They will use these texts as models for the production of their own texts and will consider the constraints and benefits of constructing and writing to a particular audience. They will consider if and why young adult novels are abbreviated or limited in relationship to adult literature. In addition to reading about ten novels, they will complete several creative exercises leading up to a final portfolio. Additional reading assignments or projects will distinguish this course from its undergraduate version. Students will not receive credit for both ENGL 468 and ENGL 568.

This course surveys primarily contemporary literature by writers who identify as gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, transgender, or queer. By studying the self-representation and culturally unique perspective of this emerging canon of writers, students in this course understand the emergence of LGBTQ literary traditions and understand the cultural diversity within these traditions. Students learn to identify the aesthetic qualities (such as camp, performativity, coded subtexts, homoeroticism, and the relationship between creativity and sexuality), and historical, political, and social concerns that characterize LGBTQ literary and cultural production. Topics covered include the struggle for civil rights before and after Stonewall, coming out narratives, the negotiation of homophobic cultures, post-colonial writers, and memoirs of the LGBTQ experience, as well as the historical emergence of sexual categories and the literary critique of heteronormativity. This course counts toward the English discipline diversity requirement.

In Writing for Civic Literacy, students will study how politicians, the media and critical citizens use language to engage with the broader community. Students themselves will learn to use language to become more active, well-informed citizens. They will study rhetorical awareness, audience analysis and persuasive writing techniques and put those lessons to use in community settings. They will perform community service at agencies of their choosing and use those experiences as objects of analysis, researching the social context in which those agencies operate and writing analytically about the agencies. Further, students will synthesize classroom lessons and real-world experience by executing writing tasks for and with the agencies (these tasks might include editorials for the local press, informational webpages and fundraising materials).

In this course participants will explore the young adult novel from the point-of-view of a reader and a writer. They will read recently published and critically acclaimed popular young adult novels. They will use these texts to explore such issues as gender, race and identity as they relate to young adult lives and their respective cultures generally. They will use these texts as models for the production of their own texts and will consider if and why young adult novels are abbreviated or limited in relationship to adult literature. In addition to reading about ten novels, they will complete several creative exercises leading up to a final portfolio.

Cultural conflicts over pollution, disease etiology, development and natural resources often originate and are played out in local ecosystems.  Anthropologists are increasingly becoming involved as researchers, developers, and activists in these cultural strifes.  This course reviews the work of environmental and medical anthropologists as well as other critical scholars who unravel the values, meanings and ideologies associated with ecological issues in given localities.  Drawing on theoretical advances in critical medical anthropology, environmental anthropology and applied anthropology, the course seeks to improve the knowledge and abilities of student anthropologists in their environmental health work.

The seminar is modeled after New Detroit’s Multicultural Leadership Series. The format offers a highly innovative approach to building competences to address (ethnic, racial, gender, and sexual orientation) topics relevant to the metropolitan Detroit region. Students attend off-campus sessions where they spend the day immersed in that culture. Each session offers an in-depth look at (but not limited to) the history, culture, and socioeconomic issues that are germane but also transcend regional barriers. Goals of the course: 1) Bridge communication gaps; promote better understanding and appreciation among all people. 2) Develop a greater understanding of the distinctive and subtle differences within our community. 3) Explore various tools to enhance communication and collaborations geared towards closing our regional divide.

This course provides a theoretical foundation for using writing to communicate and learn for personal and professional purposes. Emphasis will be placed on learning effective instructional strategies including modeling, using mentor text (high-quality writing examples to emulate), conferencing with others about one's writing, and peer-and self-assessing writing to support all writers' development. For the first half of the course, students will focus on developing their own writing skills using the writing process with three genres (narrative, informational/explanatory, and argumentative). Additional application of course knowlege will be demostrated during the second half of the semester through an academic service learning project designed to tutor elementary writers. (F)

The fixed income market, accompanied by the introduction of sophisticated financial engineering techniques, has grown enormously over the last two decades. Today, the fixed income market has been a vital segment of the global financial market. This course covers major topics associated with this market, including bond pricing, yields, and volatility; term structure of interest rates and yield curve; market structure and analytical techniques for Treasury, municipal, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and bond with embedded options. The fundamental objective of this course is to help students develop analytical skills for pricing fixed income securities and managing interest rate risk. In addition, materials covered in this course are compatible with the Common Body of Knowledge in Analysis of Debt Investments that is required by the Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA) examination. Students will not receive credit for both FIN 456 and FIN 656.

World Regional Geography includes a systematic study of the world's geographic realms and regions, including Europe, Russia, Australia-New Zealand, East Asia, South Asia, Southwest Asia, N Africa, Subsaharan Africa, Middle and South America. Geographic concepts, such as map reading and spatial analysis, are first introduced. Then, the world is classified into geographic realms and regions using both physical and social criteria. Each region results from a unique interaction between the human societies and the physical environment. The physical, cultural, political, economic and social features of each region are studied, along with any special regional concerns or problems.

Study of the geology (stratigraphy, structure and geomorphology) of major national parks. Specific parks to be visited varies from year to year, enabling the course to be repeated once for credit. Emphasis is placed on taking field  notes, describing rock sequences in outcrop, geologic map reading and aerial photograph interpretation. Special attention is focused on the understanding and development of cratonic sequences, particularly the regional correlation (both lithostratigraphic and time-stratigraphic) of sandstone, shale and limestone facies, and small and large scale geologic features such as folds and faults. Depending on the national park being visited the students may explore paleographic and paleoclimatic evidence from fossils as well as sedimentary structures. This is a field-oriented course requiring a significant amount of physical exertion. (YR)

The study of how the geosciences can be used to solve community-based environmental problems. Taught within the context of the Rouge River watershed, one of the most urbanized watersheds in the country, the focus of this 3-week course is water and watersheds. Classroom lectures are combined with extensive field work, field trips and guest speakers. Taught as a summer II course in July primarily for teachers (middle school and high school) with little or no background in geology. Teachers taking this course serve as mentors for their respective students. Teachers also spend time developing modules that can be incorporated into their existing classroom activities.

 In this course, we explore the history of German cinema through primary and secondary texts on films from the silent period through unification. Concomitantly, we will read a Mary Fulbrook's history of Germany in order to place these films within the proper historical contexts and in order to enable us to examine the ways in which German history has insinuated itself in all film genres. The film section highlights the major movement in German cinema since its inception and gives particular attention to the representations of German history and the ways in which German history makes itself apparent in a variety of genres. The class will also consider the interactions between German cinema and Hollywood through clips highlighted in lectures and student presentations. (OC).

In this course, students can obtain fundamental knowledge on stylized facts of Japanese economy as compared with those in the US and some other countries, and understand economic theories to put profound interpretations on them. Stylized facts seem to be old and some of them may have been obsolete, although they contain essential logical points. However, they are still useful for understanding Japanese economic systems. Thus, students are required to discuss current conditions on Japanese economy and firm system, considering stylized facts and theoretical backgrounds. It is essential to distinguish between changing phenomena and unchanged principles. Students have an opportunity to take a tour to a factory in a leading company. In the final class, students have to give team presentations and individually submit a short essay on the topics provided or the ones they come up with. As for the structure of the classes, we cover fundamental stylized facts, economic theories (or theoretical frameworks), and data analyses (historically and currently). This course is composed of three parts: (1) Japanese economic system, (2) Japanese firm system and (3) Japanese macroeconomic conditions.

Community organizing is a process by which communities and organizations work together to identify common problems and objectives, acquire and mobilize resources, and create and implement actions to achieve their goals. Community organizing is of interest to sociologists, organization theorists, political scientists, health educators, and social psychologists, among others, as scholars who contribute to our knowledge of working in and with communities. Drawing on these various disciplines and real world case studies, this course examines community organizing theories, models, and principles and how they are used to improve community health and address health inequities. Several practical tools, strategies, and skills are also introduced, including: community assessment, coalition-building, participatory research and evaluation, media advocacy, and policy advocacy. A primary component of this course is the field experience, in which students are partnered with community-based organizations to identify, apply, and reflect on course concepts, while contributing to local community building efforts related to various health issues in the Detroit Metropolitan region.

This course discusses the nature of and important statistical methods for analyzing healthcare related data.  The course begins by covering the structure and semantics of coding systems used in the healthcare industry while avoiding detailed coverage of the meaning of data values.  Descriptive statistical methods (graphical and numerical) that depict the central tendency and variability of data; theoretical and empirical probability distributions for discrete and continuous data; point and interval estimations of unknown parameter values; parametric and nonparametric hypothesis tests for numerical, categorical, and ordinal data; analysis of variance; and regression analysis are then covered.  A statistical software package will be used to analyze healthcare data.

TOPICI TITLE: Population Health - Determinants, Evaluation, and Opportunities for Public
Much too often, population health is understood to be either a “sum” of the health of individuals comprising the population or to be identical with public health. Yet, population health is distinct in its definition, determinants/ risk factors, measurement/evaluation, and strategies for improvement from both individual health and public health. Population health encompasses traditional public health and individual-level preventive medicine but emphasizes the full range of health determinants affecting the entire population rather than only ill or high-risk individuals.

The American health care system faces two problems: access to health services and high and rising costs. This course looks at the problems of uninsured citizens as well as the strains placed on health care facilities in providing services for them. Europeans have dealt with problems of access and cost controls through universal health care coverage and the course takes up various models in use today. The course also looks at American health insurance and "managed care" programs such as HMOs and PPOs as methods of providing health coverage as well as controlling costs. The course introduces students to services provided by the government including Medicare, Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Students will learn the basics of creating a budget under constraints such as contractual limitations and Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). Offered once a year, ordinarily in the Winter semester. Students cannot receive credit for more than one of the following: HPS 404, HPS 451, HPS 504, HPS 551, or PADM 451.

This course aims to introduce students to the fundamentals of the lifecourse perspective on health, while using “obesity” as a unifying example to illustrate its theoretical linkages to individual and population health, the practical implications for the administration and financing of the health care system, and for framing policy options.  The course highlights the differential impact of obesity on (1) the health and socioeconomic achievement of individuals at various stages in the lifecourse; (2) the population health and economic needs or opportunities, as derived from the lifecourse profile of a specific population (i.e., age distribution and aging trends) and in the context of a changing structure of society; and (3) the demand for healthcare services and other stressors on the healthcare system.  The course identifies the rationale, goals, scope, design, and potential for successful implementation of obesity-reducing policy interventions at different points during the lifecourse.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of reproductive health in the US.  Understanding women’s reproductive health requires consideration of the intersections of gender, race, class, culture, geography, economic status, and nation within a sociopolitical context.  The course introduces students to the historical trends in the regulation of women’s fertility and reproductive health.  Readings draw from a number of different disciplines, including: law, medical studies, history, social sciences, and personal narratives to critically examine the intent and impact of current standards for reproductive health policy and practice.  Topics include: reproductive justice, contraception, pregnancy, reproductive control, and family leave.  Course discussions include a focus on health policy and activism to affect change related to women’s reproductive health, all within a framework of reproductive justice.  A major emphasis is on developing critical thinking skills that can be applied to issues of women’s reproductive health in order to educate and empower students to become proactive healthcare consumers.

Diversity Issues in Mental Health explores varied cultural descriptions and models of mental illness. By focusing on the ways that culture shapes how people experience, and respond to, mental illness this class explores cultural representations of mental illness, ranging from discrete illness resulting from a chemical imbalance to a profound threat to order. We seek to understand the cultural, personal, and political underpinnings of mental illness and medical practices in societies throughout the world. The course utilizes an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing from multiple sources of information regarding mental health issues, including feminism, psychiatry, history, sociology, and literature. Issues raised throughout the course include the ways gender, race, culture, religion, and stigma influence the diagnosis of mental illness, patterns of help-seeking behavior, formation of comprehensive mental health policy, and treatment options.

The American health care system faces two great problems: access to health services and high and rising costs. This course looks at the problems of uninsured citizens as well as the strains placed on health care facilities in providing services for them. Europeans have dealt with problems of access and cost controls through universal health care coverage and the course takes up various models in use today. The course also looks at American health insurance and "managed care" programs such as HMOs and PPOs as methods of providing health coverage as well as controlling costs. The course introduces students to services provided by the government including Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP. Students will learn the basics of creating a budget under constraints such as contractual limitations and Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). Offered once a year, ordinarily in the Winter semester. Students cannot receive credit for more than one of the following: HPS 404, HPS 504, HPS 451, HPS 551, or PADM 451. (W)

This course aims to introdcue students in the fundamentals of the lifecourse perspectives on health, while using "obesity" as a unifying example to illustrate its theoretical linkages to individual and population health, the practical implications for the administration and financing of the health care system, and for framing policy options. The course highlights the differential impact of obesity on (1) the health and socioeconomic achievement of individuals at various stages in the lifecourse; (2) the population health and economic needs or opportunities, as derived from the lifecourse profile of a specific population (i.e., age distribution and aging trends) and in the context of a changing structure of society; and (3) the demand for healthcare services and other stressors on the healthcare system. The course identifies the rationale, goals, scope, design, and potential for successful implementation of obesity-reducing policy interventions at different points during the lifecourse. (W)

This class offers students a chance to study 19th and 20th century Polish history.  We look at how the most prominent ideals of what it means to be Polish – framed as a discussion between the Romantics and Positivists; the Fighters/Insurgents and Realists; the Old and New – affected the perceptions on honor, heroism, and Polish patriotism.  A critical evaluation of these models leads us to evaluate the most important historical events in the last two centuries of Polish history – a country with impressive history of openness and multiculturalism as well as grim chapters of xenophobia.  Centered on the role of individuals in shaping history, this class also reflects on the identity of Poles – citizens of a country located at the cross-roads of Eastern and Western Europe.

Full Course Title: Dark History and Untold Stories: Field Class in Caribbean Historical Archaeology. 
Field Class: involves international travel and required costs in addition to tuition. This class explores the story behind Caribbean "paradise." We use the analytical methods of historical archaeology to "read" sites of enslavement and resistance, as well as modern museum interpretations of Caribbean heritage, and engage in the production of new archaeological knowledge through excavation. We will ask how negative or "dark" history should be remembered, what life was like on Caribbean plantations, and how histories of slavery are relevant now. Throughout, we will examine how archaeology can tell the untold stories of the many people-black, white, free, and enslaved-who never made it into the history books. We will also contribute new voices with a "mini-field session" of archaeological excavation: students can gain a glimpse into scientific archaeology, and get to try out fieldwork to see if they would gain from a full field school.

 Will compare several Islamic movements in Middle Eastern history, starting with the rise of Islam in Mecca and Medina. Later impulses toward Islamic revival all looked back to the first movement, and hoped to capture both its spirit and its success. With this as background, the course will move to address two questions: How did later Islamic movements understand the history of the rise of Islam? How have later Islamic movements had to adapt their methods and their ideology to different historical circumstances? (AY).

As a novel form of social and spatial organization, the rise of the modern industrial city transformed the European landscape. This course tracks the growth and development of the city in modern Europe, focusing particularly on London, Paris and Berlin. The course considers the physical landscape of the industrial city and the infrastructural challenges of rapid urbanization, political revolution, the exercise of political power and social control in urban space, as well as intellectual and artistic responses to the urban environment. In the final two units of the course we consider 20th-century challenges to the model of urban modernity that has carried over from the nineteenth century, and which remains so powerful today.

This course covers the social and political history of the Middle East from the rise of Islam through several key transformations to 1800.  We will examine the Middle East as the center of caliphal empires, as a place of political fragmentation, as a home to increasingly diverse ethnic and religious groups, as a region within an expanding Islamic world, and as the domain of the three so-called “gunpower empires” (the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties).

HIST 3632 will examine the involvement of the US in the Middle East from the late 18th Century to modern times. The relationship between domestic politics and foreign policy (both in the US and in the Middle East) will be examined as US involvement in the Middle East grows from irregular missionary and commercial activity in the 19th century, to the establishment full diplomatic relations, to the complexities related to the globalization of the oil industry, Cold War interventions and, ultimately, the establishment of US hegemony in the region. Students will examine a number of "case studies" in US-Middle East relations as a platform for their own research into other episodes of American involvement in the Middle East. (YR)

Using the biography of Henry Ford as a touchstone, the course will examine the trajectories of historical change and regional development between 1870 and 1950. Of fundamental concern will be southeastern Michigan's transformation from a 19th century outpost on the Great Lakes to the nation's "engine of change" in the 20th century. Henry Ford was the major player in that revolutionary transformation. This course examines his role in history and mythology as well as the causes and implications of that transformation. (OC).

 This course examines the development of urban America from the European-style port cities of the colonial period through the edge cities of today.  The bulk of the course will focus on the late 19th and 20th century urban environment with an eye towards understanding the diverse residents, cultures, economies, and geographies that have shaped American cities. We will cover everything from developments in transportation, architecture, business, and technology to immigration, politics, and urban culture. Broad concerns and constituencies have shaped the urban public sphere, the physical development of cities and the experience of living as an urbanite and, consequently, they will receive much of our attention.  American patterns of development will then be placed in context with those of other nations and cultures. (AY).

In this course we will try to examine the historical circumstances and contexts surrounding the writing of The Hebrew Bible. Roughly speaking, we will begin by exploring three aspects of the subject: Historical context of the writing of the Bible-i.e. during the organizing and communicating of each segment. History of the canonization: the ideas and rationale behind including some books but not others. History in the Bible. In more specific terms, this will entail examining who wrote the Bible, when and why. The narrative incorporates the movement from an oral tradition to a written one and will demand some focus on certain pivotal moments, e.g., Ezra's reading (cf. Ezra-Nehemiah), or the historical events in Kings and Chronicles, or the defeat of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 B.C.E. (BC) and of the southern kingdom of Judah in 589 B.C.E.

Full Title: Inside-Out Prison Exchange: Reading Camp and Prison Narratives
The course invites students to reflect on various prison narritives from select European countries. We will investigate how men and women of different races and ethnicities experienced oppression and how they used their bodies and developed skills to remain human in dehumanizing conditions. This provides students with an opportunity to reflect on the circumstances that led to their imprisonment, but also with a way to examine how they narrated their life stories. While doing the course will examine the concept of agency as something that frames life stories. Finally, it will allow students to reflect on various ways individuals in various circumstances struggle to remake their lives inside as well as outside of prison. Various categories, such as gender, art, resistance, body and space will help us navigate through rich primary source material, which includes memoirs, drawings, paintings, and poems created within a constrained space of prisons and camps. 

The course is part of the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program, which combines a theoretical knowledge with practical understanding and experience by holding class inside Macomb Correctional Facility throughout the semester. The class has roughly equal numbers of UMD students and incarcerated students, and utilizes a variety of active learning techniques, leading to the production of one or more class projects by the end of the course.

 TOPIC TITLE: State, Culture and Society in Modern Iran. For Iranian specialist, these are exciting times.  There is a new wave of interdisciplinary research on Iran coinciding with a surge of political and intellectual debate about the direction of contemporary Iranian society.  Honors students will capitalize on this in the tutorial by examining Iranian history and society from a number of interrelated standpoints: historical, legal, literary, anthropological and cinematic.  We will cover the followng topics: the rise of the modern state in Iran (from sacral kingship to the Islamic Republic), Twelver Shi a Islam in Iran (including the rise of modern clergy and heretical off-shoots), Islamic revivalism in Iran (Al-Afghani, Khomeini and the Islamic- Marxist, Ali Shari ati and reformist Abd al-Karim Sorush), modern Persian prose (Jamalzadeh, Daneshvar, Chubak and Al-e Ahmad), America and Iran and economy and society in Iran (oil industry, urbanization and mass media culture). These topics will be explored through a combination of research monographs, translated literary or historical material (e.g., both of Iran's constitutions) and films. Students will read, discuss and write on the following text: The Mantle of the Prophet by Roy Mottahedeh and The Daughters of Quchan by Afsaneh Najmabadi (history), The Children of Deh Koh by Erika Friedl and Law of Desire by Shahla Haeri (anthropology), Persian is Sugar by Mohammad Ali Jamalzadeh, Savushun by Simin Daneshvar, The Patient Stone by Sadeq Chuba (fiction), and Weststruckness by Jalal Al-e Ahmad (social criticism).

Topic: The Native American Past. This course introduces students to the long and rich history of America's First Peoples from earliest times to the present.  Although the topics covered in class will be wide-ranging, the course emphasizes certain unifying themes:  the diversity of indigenous peoples and cultures; the agency of First Peoples; the political, economic, and cultural dimensions of European/Indian accommodation and resistance; the evolution of government Indian polices and Native American responses to them; and contemporary issues confronting native peoples. The course examines the Native American Past from native people's perspectives, by including the unfamiliar voices of those peoples in more familiar accounts of America's past, and by introducing students to ways of studying neglected parts of the past and to some of the varied ways that historians (both Native and non-Native) have interpreted the Native American past.

During the early modern period, merchants, explorers and travelers set out from the European West in unprecedented voyages of discovery, intensifying interaction between cultures and initiating contact with previously unknown civilizations. In this advances seminar we examine original documents (in English) as well as current scholarship about encounters between groups of Europeans and inhabitants of other parts of the world from the perspective of both sides. Comparing these contradictory (and often incompatible) accounts of the same events, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the process of European expansion, and of the strengths (and limitations) of historical sources. Additional assignments will distinguish the undergraduate and graduate versions of this course.

In this advanced reading seminar, students explore major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of borderlands history. Borderlands history is a growing historical field that focuses on interactions of peoples and empires across present day national boundaries. Borderlands history is a historical approach that originated among historians of the United States, so a majority of our readings focus on North America. Many of the insights of the U.S. borderlands history, however, have influenced historians of borderlands regions worldwide, and so we also read borderlands histories focusing on other regions of the world, particularly China and Central Eurasia.

This course is unlike other courses offered by the history discipline in that its primary function is to introduce students to the process of intensive historical inquiry with its end being the production of a high-quality, original research paper. As a seminar, it is intended for advanced concentrators who will research their own specialized topics within the intellectual community of the seminar?providing support and enrichment for the other class members. The general theme for the semester is ?Microhistory.?  Within this general rubric we will be focusing upon three major issues: 1) Microhistory as a tool of historical investigation/analysis [i.e., what is microhistory?], 2) the advantages/disadvantages of this approach to historical inquiry [what can it reveal for us?], and 3) employing the technique to produce a discrete microhistorical study [how do we do it?].  The overall purpose of this micro-level approach is to provide a distinct, readily accessible medium through which to consider broader historical trends.

During the early modern period, merchants, explorers and travelers set out from the European West in unprecedented voyages of discovery, intensifying interaction between cultures and initiating contact with previously unknown civilizations. In this advances seminar we examine original documents (in English) as well as current scholarship about encounters between groups of Europeans and inhabitants of other parts of the world from the perspective of both sides. Comparing these contradictory (and often incompatible) accounts of the same events, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the process of European expansion, and of the strengths (and limitations) of historical sources. Additional assignments will distinguish the undergraduate and graduate versions of this course.

 This course explores the history and aesthetics of Black sacred music within cultural context. Major figures (Thomas A. Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson, The Winans Family, Kirk Franklin), periods (slavery, Great Migration, Civil Rights movement), and styles (folk and arranged Negro spirituals, congregational songs, and gospel songs - traditional to contemporary) will be studied through recordings, videos, film, and at least one field experience. Underlying the course is the theory (Mellonee Burnim and Pearl Williams-Jones) that gospel music is an expression of African American culture that fuses both African and European elements into a unique whole.

Through a historical survey of female musicians from the Middle Ages to the present day, this course takes a critical look at theories of creativity and professionalism as they relate to female musical production. The course deals with women in European "art music" traditions and also in jazz and poplar music. Social and cultural norms dictating appropriate female involvement with music are examined. The historical approach will serve to reveal ways in which terms such as professionalism and virtuosity have continually shifted and changed in reference to female musical performance. The course challenges students to re-think many of the commonly accepted gender-based descriptions of particular genres and elements of music through listening and musical analysis.

 This course explores the history and aesthetics of Black sacred music within cultural context. Major figures (Thomas A. Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson, The Winans Family, Kirk Franklin), periods (slavery, Great Migration, Civil Rights movement), and styles (folk and arranged Negro spirituals, congregational songs, and gospel songs - traditional to contemporary) will be studied through recording, videos, film and at least one field experience. Underlying the course is the theory (Mellonee Burnim and Pearl Williams-Jones) that gospel music is an expression of African American culture that fuses both African and European elements into a unique whole.

Women have often been regarded as the second sex of the middle ages due to the misogynistic attitudes of that era. Recent scholarship, however, has unearthed a significantly more complex picture. Through a study of visual representations of women in medieval art, this course will examine women's roles in the creation and patronage of art and literature, economic and family issues, and women's participation in new and innovative forms of religious piety.

Through a historical survey of female musicians from the Middle Ages to the present day, this course takes a critical look at theories of creativity and professionalism as they relate to female musical production. The course deals with women in European "art music" traditions and also in jazz and poplar music. Social and cultural norms dictating appropriate female involvement with music are examined. The historical approach will serve to reveal ways in which terms such as professionalism and virtuosity have continually shifted and changed in reference to female musical performance. The course challenges students to re-think many of the commonly accepted gender-based descriptions of particular genres and elements of music through listening and musical analysis.

This course explores the adaptation of literary texts in a variety of literary genres (poetry, drama, fiction) to other artistic mediums (film, graphic novels/comics, paintings, etc.). Moving beyond limited comparisons of "good" originals and "bad" adaptations, this course focuses on the dialogue among multiple versions of the same story across a range of historical periods, asking how and why adaptations modify their sources in a particular manner. This course addresses the difference between adaptation and appropriation as well as imitation, quotation, allusion, pastiche, and parody.

This course will study selected readings from the Bible, first in regard to their own literary, historical, and cultural contents, and then in regard to their reception, interpretation, and reapplication by later literary tradition. Biblical selections may cover both the Old and New Testaments as well as Apocryphal traditions, while readings from later non-biblical texts will be drawn from various literary periods.

This course questions the literary techniques and forms the English writers developed between 1660 and 1900 to characterize and imagine London to be a unified community and to counter the growing perception of London as a "monstrous city." This image of "the English-speaking City" as an uncontrollable monster may be explored in writings by Daniel Defoe, Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, Robert Louis Stevenson, Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, and Joseph Conrad.

This course examines the different perspectives that feminist theorists have offered to analyze the unequal conditions of women's and men's lives. Students taking this course will develop an understanding of how theory functions as a way to know, understand and change the world. They will also be provided with a lens for comparing the assumptions and implications of alternative theoretical perspectives. A particular emphasis of this course is on theorizing the interrelationships among gender, race, class, sexuality and nationality. Course material includes applications of feminist theory to issues such as gender identity formation; sexuality; gender, law and citizenship; women and work; and the history and politics of social movements. Students will not receive credit for both HUM 409 and HUM 509. (AY)

 This course will be taught in English, and will focus on the influence of Italian literary models for the construction of female literary types as well as female voices in France and Italy from 1300 to about 1600. Italian authors studied include three very influential Florentines, Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, as well as Castiglione and Ariosto. We will read women poets, patrons, prostitutes and queens from Italy and France such as Veronica Gambara, Isabella di Morra, Vittoria Colonna, Christine de Pizan, Louise Labe, and Marguerite de Navarre. At issue will be women's roles and women's images in city and court culture during the early modern period, and the interaction of their writings with the literary canons of Italy and France. (OC).

 This course will analyze ethnographic films as a medium for the construction of meaning in and across cultures. It will teach students to understand how the putatively "real" content of documentary film creates a mixture of fantasy, news and "science." Covering texts as varied as National Geographic photographic layouts, traditional ethnographic films made by anthropologists, and auto-ethnographies of cultural groups such as native Americans and the Trobriand Islanders of Papua, New Guinea, the course will aim to deconstruct such oppositions as indigene vs. alien, us vs. them, and self vs. other. Students cannot receive credit for both HUM 477 and HUM 577. (YR).

This course examines the different perspectives that feminist theorists have offered to analyze the unequal conditions of women's and men's lives. Students taking this course will develop an understanding of how theory functions as a way to know, understand and change the world. They will also be provided with a lens for comparing the assumptions and implications of alternative theoretical perspectives. A particular emphasis of this course is on theorizing the interrelationships among gender, race, class, sexuality and nationality. Course material includes applications of feminist theory to issues such as gender identity formation; sexuality; gender, law and citizenship; women and work; and the history and politics of social movements. Students will not receive credit for both HUM 409 and HUM 509. Additional reading assignments or projects will distinguish this course from its undergraduate version.

This course will be taught in English, and will focus in the influence of Italian literary models for the construction of female literary types as well as female voices in France and Italy from 1300 to about 1600. Italian authors studied include three very influential Florentines, Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, as well as Castiglione and Ariosto. We will read women poets, patrons, prostitutes and queens from Italy and France such as Veronica Gambara, Isabella di Morra, Vittoria Colonna, Christine de Pizan, Louise Labe, and Marguerite de Navarre. At issue will be women's roles and women's images in city and court culture during the early modern period, and the interaction of their writings with the literary canons of Italy and France. (OC).
