In this course, students can obtain fundamental knowledge on stylized facts of Japanese economy and Japanese firm systems as compared with those in the US and some other countries, and understand economic theories to put profound interpretations on them.  Stylized facts seem to be old and some of them may have been obsolete, although they contain essential logical points.  However, they are still useful for understanding Japanese economic systems.  Thus, students are required to discuss current conditions on Japanese economy and firm system, considering stylized facts and theoretical backgrounds.  It is essential to distinguish between changing phenomena and unchanged principles.  Students have an opportunity to take a tour to a factory in a leading company.  In the final class, students have to give team presentations and individually submit a short essay on the topics provided or the ones they come up with.  As for the structure of classes, we cover fundamental stylized facts, economic theories (or theoretical frameworks), and data analyses (historically and currently).  This course is composed of three parts: (1) Japanese economic system, (2) Japanese firm system and (3) Japanese macroeconomic conditions.

 This hands-on course will introduce students to the basic theories of audio and audio program production, including the fundamentals of digital audio and studio and remote recording.  The course is designed to instill upon students the importance of sound in the electronic media and how its use or misuse can enhance or detract from media productions.  Readings, lectures and projects are designed to teach students how to discern good audio from bad and how to avoid pitfalls media producers and directors commonly make.  Through the practical application of audio concepts in the radio laboratory and through critiques of radio projects and programs, students will gain the insight and experience they will need to successfully design and execute audio strategies for the electronic media.

The course will concentrate on a series of films from various European countries with a focus on the socio-political issues, historical events and cultural preoccupations that have defined and also challenged European societies from WWII to the present. Zeroing in on the construction of European identities, the course will analyze and compare modes of narrating national, class, racial, sexual and social differences in different European nations. Themes such as memories of war and the Holocaust, new conflicts, class, immigration, women's rights, gender, and East-West relations will be addressed. The course will thus privilege a cinema that offers a "récit," a story. Particular attention will be given to discourses on otherness and on the ways in which film culture has reflected, reinforced, reshaped and, in some instances, contested Europe's past and current dominant ideologies, and identities. Readings by cultural historians and analysts will provide the context for an understanding of the films. The course will conclude with a discussion of the possible existence of a specific postwar European Cinema.

 This course will analyze ethnographic films as a medium for the construction of meaning in and across cultures. It will teach students to understand how the putatively "real" content of documentary film creates a mixture of fantasy, news and "science."  Covering texts as varied as National Geographic photographic layouts, traditional ethnographic films made by anthropologists, and auto-ethnographies of cultural groups such as Native Americans and the Trobriand Islanders of Papua, New Guinea, the course will aim to deconstruct such oppositions as indigene vs. alien, us vs. them, and self vs. other. Students cannot receive credit for both FILM 477 and FILM 577. (AY).

This course will analyze ethnographic films as a medium for the construction of meaning in and across cultures. It will teach students to understand how putatively "real" content of documentary film creates a mixture of fantasy, news and "science". Covering texts as varied as National Geographic photographic layouts, traditional ethnographic films made by anthropologists, and auto-ethnographies of cultural groups such as Native Americans and the Trobriand Islanders of Papua New Guinea, the course will aim to deconstruct such oppositions as indigene vs. alien, us vs. them, and self vs. other.

 From a single artifact (an object or a text), students will learn to build an understanding of an entire culture in a given historical moment. First by analyzing the artifact and then by building a larger context in which to interpret the significance of that artifact, students will also build their own academic community. By the end of the course, each student will have mastered the use of all library research resources and have developed a specific expertise in an area of research related to the artifact. By the end of the course, the class will have organized its own academic conference on the artifact in which they will share their research and insights. The professor will be a specialist in the area from which the artifact is selected and will guide you in your mastery of research skills and acculturation to academic life. (F).

 This course examines the history, rhetoric, and social context of American citizen activism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Topics will include African American abolitionist and civil rights activism, women's suffrage, the home economics movement, the labor movement, educational reform, and student political involvement on college campuses. We will also pay special attention to how these movements played out locally. Our goal throughout will be to understand how ordinary citizens used language to effect social change - and how we today might do the same. (F)

What has made the plays of Shakespeare so relevant to a well-rounded education in universities around the world? How do Shakespeare's plays transcend his period making him, in Ben Jonson's words, "not of age, but for all time"? In this course we shall discuss the literary, stage and film traditions of Shakespeare's plays as well as the wholesale borrowings from, echoes and parodies of them in popular culture, from Dr. Who to graphic novels, and the commercialization of Shakespeare in such unlikely mediums as Levis jean commercials. This course challenges students to consider how the medium of the artistic work (e.g. film, play, illustration) affects interpretation and how the artisitc work is conditioned by the social contexts of its time. From comic books to live performance, Slings and Arrows to Kenneth Branagh, this course explores the textual, performance and visual history of a selection of Shakespeare's plays and the cultural signifigance of Shakespeare today. Note: the course will include an excursion to see a play at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada.

 This course explores the role of fast food in our society. Fast food is something we take for granted, yet it has helped shape our culture as well as our economy and is a key symbol of the American lifestyle to the rest of the world. In this course we will examine the history of the fast food industry, the nature of work in the fast food sector,  the global reach of corporations like McDonald's and Starbucks, the environmental impact of food production, and the rise of the "slow food" movement. The course will introduce students to perspectives from the social and behavioral sciences including economics, sociology, anthropology, environmental studies, science and technology studies, politics, and history.

 This course will use visual perception and its organization in the brain and related phenomena such as attention and memory as tools to explore the issue of where in the brain consciousness is located, and what the necessary and sufficient criteria for consciousness are. A central premise is that consciousness, formerly the sole province of philosophers, can now be studied empirically using scientific methodologies. (F)

This course will focus on gender and close relationships. We will examine how pop culture (including popular movies and self-help psychology books) tend to construct gender as a naturally occurring dichotomy, emphasizing the "vast" differences between women and men. For example, John Gray's relationship self-help book titled "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" has sold millions of copies and has helped to perpetuate the idea that women and men are so different as to be considered different species. The course will introduce students to perspectives from various disciplines including psychology, sociology, communications and gender studies. Using theory and scientific research from these various disciplines, students will learn to critically examine the ways that gender and close relationships are portrayed in our society.

This course explores the aspects of the conflict between religion and science in America using the Scopes Trial of 1925 as the primary case study. The trial centered on the teaching of certain ideas generally thought to be part of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution via natural selection. These claims will be evaluated by examining the science of Darwin's "On the Origin of Species". The political debate will be examined first in the context of Thomas Jefferson's writings on democratic policy and science, and then from the perspective of early populist and fundamentalist reaction to Darwinism. The subsequent development of Darwinism patterns in American social, ethical, and literary thought will also be explored, as will the rise of the modern creationist movement. The course will conclude with an analysis of the political, educational, and scientific response to that movement.

In this class we will look at how our own experiences conform to or challenge popular myths and narratives about the historical and contemporary college experience in America. We will study how college life is constructed in novels, newspapers, diaries, letters, personal interviews, essays, textbooks and films. While reading and writing about the college experience, we will address the intersection between fact and fiction and explore how print and visual representations might shape our perceptions of our world. Overall, students' own stories as college students will be crucial to the class's investigation, assessment and production of college life narratives.

What does it mean to be human? Can machines fall in love? Can our consciousness be transmitted to another human being or substance? Is language fundamental to communication of thought? If so how would communication with other life forms proceed? These questions have traditionally been the domain of science fiction. However, given advances in technology, scientists are asking these questions with increasing frequency. This course explores the interplay between science and fiction. Each week we will examine a particular question through both science and fiction (book, film, etc) and see to what extent the science coincides with, or deviates from, the fiction. There will be a heavy emphasis on topics in cognitive science - an interdisciplinary science of mind and intelligence encompassing fields such as cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguistics, neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

An examination of American citizenship as understood and practices in a variety of arenas of public life. We will examine both historical and contemporary perspectives on citizenship, including the ways in which public discourse helps situate Americans? understanding of the idea of citizenship, and by extension, the practice of democracy. In addition to exploring citizenship as it operates in the political arena and civil society, we will emphasize the role of higher education in nurturing active citizenship. This seminar includes an academic service learning requirement. Academic service learning is an educational method that integrates volunteer community service with course material to enhance the learning objectives of the course. Students will be expected to participate in a carefully-chosen and instructor-approved civic activity (e.g., volunteerism, democratic participation, public advocacy) that will highlight different models of citizenship in practice.

This course will pursue two distinct themes. The first is the triumphs of modern statistical methodology in science during the last hundred years. Definitive studies such as the Salk Vaccine Field Trials and those involving the smoking and lung cancer controversy will be examined in depth. The second theme is the awareness and use of public access databases, which are also used by researchers and policymakers. These include the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database of cancer registries, the Statistical Abstract of the United States, and SearchSystems.net Public Records Directory. The course will involve a number of readings and the interpretations of data that will form the basis of classroom discussion and written reports.

An exploration of how artists and writers represent urban trauma (terror, violence, destruction, absence) to describe indescribable suffering. In the wake of urban chaos, how do writers make urban community possible? To answer this question, we will examine traumatic events in New York City (9/11) as well as Detroit to understand how emails, photographs, novels, documentaries, and films try to narrate chaos and stabilize urban history. In addition to films that experiment with narrative (such as Memento [2000] and documentaries about 9/11 and Detroit), texts may include writings by psychologists (Freud), urban historians (Sugrue), cultural theorists (Baudrillard), and novelists (Joseph Conrad).

Globalization is the predominant interpretative concept through which we analyze the state of the planet in general, and the intermingling of cultures in particular. This course proposes a comprehensive examination of cultures around the world to first-year university students. A transdisciplinary approach (history, political science, economics, geography, and anthropology) will introduce students to a wide breadth of content and depth of contextualization, and enhance their understanding of the complexities of the (post)modern world. In addition to readings on the main groups of world cultures, we will analyze several films that address the issues of cultural identity and globality. The question of stereotyping cultures will be discussed through examples of parodic representations of cultures. The course will also address the tensions between local ways of life (historical, linguistic, ethnic, and religious) and today's pressures for transnational and multiple identities, intensified by the communication of ideas and the movement of people around the world. Thus, we will also look at how the cultures of immigrant communities in southeast Michigan have contributed to the local cultural configuration.

This course studies concepts of community and service within American culture. It traces the development of civic life in the U. S. by examining the promises and challenges of community and citizenship, especially questions of inclusion and exclusion in American civic life. Students are expected to engage in some form of active citizenship with this question in mind: What individual and collective actions are most effective in making our communities into places in which each person can thrive?

Who is Jesus of Nazareth? For centuries people seeking and answer have turned to the four gospels of the New Testament. But how reliable are these texts? Were they written as biographies, histories, or to fulfill other purposes? This course will address these and other questions associated with the quest for the historical Jesus. Students will be introduced to a variety of approaches involved in the literary-historical study of the gospels and New Testament backgrounds, and learn about the methods scholars employ to move from these texts and contexts to an historical portrait of Jesus. Attention will also turn to wide range of gospels not found in the New Testament to see what light they can shed on the Jesus’ identity.

Students in this seminar will explore a collection of extremely short stories-weird and wonderful stories that manage to ignite the imagination and evoke complex realities in just a few pages. Discussion of the stories, guided by provocative questions and thought experiments, will help students develop ways to navigate texts, subtexts, and contexts at a college level; to write more critically and analytically; and to read with more confidence and passion. The seminar will incorporate a series of short, focused writing assignments and some creative research projects. The goal is to discover rich worlds in tiny packages….and return safely, if somewhat altered, to the real world.

If cities are the centers of human civilization, then why have we inherited such horrific stereotypes of urban environments? This course analyzes how writers (screenwriters, dramatists, urban theories, architects novelists, and poets) tried to reimagine cities (both in America and Britain) as both a unified community of English-speaking individuals and a globalizing model of “civilized” social organization between 1660 and the present. In doing so, the course argues that our understanding the “monstrous” connotations of cities depends upon our imagining the simultaneous creation of morally “angelic” middle-class suburbs in both gothic and horror writing and visual art. Reading may include Dracula, Journal of a Plague Year, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Linden Hills, and The Jungle.

The course is based on a recent book by Daniel Kahneman, entitled "Thinking, Fast and Slow". The book is based on the premise that the human brain supports two different modes of thought: (a) a largely unconscious mode that is capable of processing large amounts of information quite quickly, and (b) a slower mode that operates more on the basis of logic.  The goals of the course would be to (a) make sure students understand these two modes and the accompanying data and rationale that support the two modes, (b) understand and be able to apply the fairly simple methodology that underlies many of the related experiments, (c) improve one's own thinking by learning when to rely on each of the two systems and how to avoid the pitfalls associated with each, and (d) be able to extend the literature by performing novel follow-up experiments based on those already performed.

This course analyzes American culture through the lens of its horror industry: in film, literature, art, and other forms of artistic and popular culture. Horror, because of its nature as an extreme form of representation and its association with the imagination rather than reality, has the ability to reveal certain truths and theories about history, culture, and ways of being that are difficult to access through other modes of expression. This course explores these truths and theories by studying American horrors in a way that contextualizes film, stories, art, and other forms of popular culture within particular social, political, and historical moments. Examples include: Cold War horror productions (the short stories of H.P. Lovecraft and Richard Matheson) and the use of aliens and other invaders as a stand in for outsiders and “others,” domestic horrors like The Nightmare on Elm Street and Beloved and the ways in which violence, gender, race and the home intersect, and a study of post-feminist heroines in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Pretty Little Liars.

This course is an interdisciplinary study of the concepts of what it means to be human and how that compares with other animal species. By examining the various ways in which nonhuman animals are objectified in their relationship to humans through religious teachings, portrayed in the media sometimes anthropomorphically, and the ways in which humans make use of animals, students will engage in their own academic inquiry leading to in-depth class discussions about the concept of what it means to be a human and a nonhuman animal.  These investigations and discussions will be based on readings and other sources to guide students’ understanding of their own and other’s attitudes to human and nonhuman animals within societies and cross-culturally.

FULL TITLE: Crossing Bounaries: Passing and Social Identity in American History
Have you ever thought that life would be easier if you had been born a different person? This course examines the stories of boundary crossers: individuals who acted on that desire and 'passed' for a member of a different social group. People who have lived on both sides of a social identity offer a unique opportunity to understand the meaning of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation in American society. Their experiences can help us understand social categories and how they have changed over the course of history. What, for example can a person who lived as both a woman and a man tell us about the significance of gender in our society? (OC)

Despite old and persistent myths of a woman?s place being in the home, women in America have consistently maintained a presence in public spaces. Their participation, however, was not unfettered. Laws, social mores, familial and religious restraints, etiquette, the threat of violence, lack of funds, and other factors influenced and restricted women?s behavior when in public and structured society?s reactions to their presence. This course will consider the development of these codes of behavior (formal and informal), how women of different ethnicities, races, sexual orientations, and classes experienced their effects, and the ways in which women sought to temper and undermine the system, particularly in the twentieth century. The course will provide an interdisciplinary approach to historic, social, physical, economic, and cultural geographies through which women have traveled.

In this course, we examine Roman art closely associated with personal commemoration and cultural memory, including portraiture, funerary monuments, imperial monuments, and public architecture. We explore these objects’ relationship to Roman literary culture’s theories of mnemotechnics, and in the social context of the Roman obsession with memory perpetuation. We also examine how art historians apply modern theories of collective and social memory in their scholarship on Roman art, creating new ways of understanding Roman sculpture, painting, and architecture. Finally, we investigate Roman spectacle and performance as a vehicle of cultural memory.  Graduate students enrolled in this seminar will be exposed in greater depth to the theoretical and historiographical scholarship of cultural and collective memory, as well as to current topics in Roman art.  Graduate students are responsible for additional reading assignments and more lengthy and substantial oral presentations and final papers, as outlined below.  Students cannot earn credit for both ARTH 428 and ARTH/LIBS 528.

 Examines the development in the last 20 years of the emergence of "postmodern" scholarship in a number of fields in the natural and social sciences, humanities, and popular culture; considers how in each case these approaches seem to challenge the authority of single explanations and absolute truth.  Addresses issues such as diversity in cultures; why cultural pressures produce new forms of relativism; the dynamics of race and gender in intercultural clashes; and the interplay of strongly held values and toleration.  Course format will require close reading of complex texts and responses to them in class discussion.

This seminar will examine theories of individual, collective, and cultural memory and their practical application. In addition, we will read three major novels in which the authors explore memory in its various forms. We will begin the semester by examining the ways in which clinical psychologists have looked at memory versus the ways in which social constructive sociologists and psychologists have viewed memory. In our examination, we will try to find some points of intersection between the two groups. This will provide the framework for further explorations of memory and the study of constructions of memory and their uses and abuses. We will focus on the ways in which memory has been conceptualized in the disciplines of art history, history, literary criticism, Holocaust studies, sociology, and psychology, as well as the interdisciplinary field of cultural studies.

This course will probe the dynamic shifts in religious subjectivity that mark the years ranging from the early Christian centuries (first and second centuries AD) to the end of the Middle Ages (1500 AD). It will attend mainly to the evidence to be found in the literary record of these two sequential periods, and will be concerned with examining a wide variety of topics, such as the formation of orthodox belief, the challenges posed by apostate and heretical sects, competing modes of ascetic life and practices, the power struggles between secular and ecclesiastical authority, and the rise of mysticism and affective piety. The course will demand close analysis and comparison of texts in class discussion as well as in written assignments.

This seminar will explore how science became a defining feature of modern life around the world in the last five centuries. We will study the so-called "Scientific Revolution" in a global context in relation to other forms of belief, such as religion and magic, and changes in human society at large. By critically studying theoretical texts, primary sources, and secondary materials tied to the emergence of the modern sciences, the seminar will challenge participants to examine their assumptions and presuppositions about what science is, how science was in the past, how science has been done, and what its history should be. We will discover how people in different cultures made knowledge of the natural world in pre-modern times, and examine why some ways of making natural knowledge became more reliable and widespread than others in recent centuries.

What do the texts reveal about Greek values, social mores, social interaction--between men and women, men and men, children and adults, gods and men?

 An extensive and intensive analysis of the roots of environmental studies. Environmental studies becomes meta-disciplinary as it makes connections between the traditional disciplines in the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and technological sciences when dealing with current environmental issues. The students will examine and discuss the philosophical, scientific, social, and religious basis of the environmental movements through classical and contemporary readings. Possible topics will include: views of nature, sustainability, carrying capacity, management of commons, the environment of cities, and developing a sense of place. Additional assignments will distinguish this course from its undergraduate version.

A review of major theories and issues concerning the relationship between ecological and economic systems.  Topics include these questions: What is the purpose of economic activity?  How important is the preservation of the natural world compared to the production of economic goods?  How do principles of social and intergenerational equity affect the use of resources and choice of goods to be produced?  The course utilizes a transdisciplinary approach in the development of new models where conventional economics and ecology alone have been ineffective in addressing questions of sustainability and equity.

Despite old and persistent myths of a woman?s place being in the home, women in America have consistently maintained a presence in public spaces. Their participation, however, was not unfettered. Laws, social mores, familial and religious restraints, etiquette, the threat of violence, lack of funds, and other factors influenced and restricted women?s behavior when in public and structured society?s reactions to their presence. This course will consider the development of these codes of behavior, formal and informal, how women of different ethnicities, races, sexual orientations, and classes experienced their effects, and the ways in which women sought to temper and undermine the system, particularly in the 20th century. This course will provide an interdisciplinary approach to historic, social physical, economic, and cultural geographies through which women have traveled. Readings will consider the scholarship generated by urban geographers, historians, sociologists, anthropologists, literary critics, economists, novelists, and journalists. Additional assignments will distinguish this course from its undergraduate version.(OC)

In this course we will explore changing conceptions of work and its impact on urban redevelopment policies. The issue will be set within a larger theme: the relationship between work and creativity. We begin with a review of writings by Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Karl Polyani, E. P. Thompson and others on the history and concept of work as a specific form of productive human activity. We will then critically examine the nature of the shift from manufacturing to services and the emergence of a new, knowledge-based system of production. Specific policies aimed at recruiting members of the "creative class" to live and work in "cool cities" - Michigan's cool cities initiative, for example - will be examined and critically evaluated.

This course is designed as a capstone experience for students in the MALS program who are interested in a non-thesis/non-project option. Its aim is to allow students to reflect and draw upon the knowledge they gained in MALS, and then apply this knowledge in class discussions, essays, and research projects on an interdisciplinary topic chosen from an agreed-upon list of topics that relate to the general MALS curriculum. In the first section of the course, students will reflect upon the interdisciplinary nature of their graduate training, drawing connections between diverse courses they have taken, pinpointing applications to the outside world, and examining the ways that interdisciplinary work has transformed their thinking. The remainder of the class will be organized around an interdisciplinary exploration of one of the following interrelated topics: "Memory", "Identity", "Place", "Community", or "Ways of Knowing". Students will examine how different disciplines and scholars approach the topic. They will also consider the relevance of this broad theme for contemporary issues and debates. Also, students should have completed at least 24 credits in the MALS program, if enrolled concurrently in a LIBS graduate course, or 27 credit otherwise, with a minimum GPA of 3.0.

Local Government Management 512 examines the concepts and develops skills needed by local government administrators in ethical decision making and professional behavior. This one hour course encourages local government officials to continually cultivate personal integrity and to respond ethically to challenging situations. Given the recent abundance of ethical failures in government and business (from Watergate to Enron and beyond); and the increasing pressures of complex social and scientific dilemmas, it is essential that leaders see ethics as the greater part of expertise. The course will cover many of the ethical issues local officials encounter, and will analyze means by which local officials can respond ethically and professionally to difficult situations. Finally, the course will explore strategies for influencing a culture of high ethical and professional standards within organizations.

This course discusses ways of encrypting information, a function which is vital to economics, defense and the empowerment of society. It is more crucial now than ever before to be able to securely transfer information in this age of electronic communication. After discussing primitive ways of encrypting information and explaining the need for more sophisticated encoding methods, this course explores the mathematics (number theory, finite fields and probability) behind both historic and more recent cryptosystems that have been developed for the secure transmission of data along non secure channels. This course continues with symmetric and public key cryptosystems, elliptic curves, digital signatures, zero knowledge protocols and other more advanced methods. This course does not assume any prior knowledge of number theory or probability. (YR)

Students will experience concrete approaches to the various topics using problem solving, manipulatives and technology as appropriate, with the intent being to help the learners discover how the ideas of calculus are useful in a variety of settings. Visual, numeric and commonsense approaches are used. No credit for CASL concentration, minor, or area of focus. Open only to certified teachers or elementary education students. Students cannot receive credit for both MATH 449 and 549. (AY)

The course provides a deep understanding of the major concepts of calculus: rates of change, accumulation (net change), area, and limits. Students will experience concrete approaches to the various topics using problem solving, manipulatives and technology as appropriate, with the intent being to help the learners discover how the ideas of calculus are useful in a variety of settings. Visual, numeric, and commonsense approaches will be used.  Open only to certified teachers or elementary education students. (YR).

This is an introductory course in discrete optimization at the graduate level for mathematics, science, engineering, and management majors. The goal of this course is to provide an overview of the problem settings in discrete optimization. In particular, the students will learn some of the fundamental combinatorial and heuristic optimization methods used in practice. The main emphasis of the course will be on modeling optimization problems mathematically and solveing them using standard optimization techniques. The course will also address the limitations and complexity of the solutions that are found. The important theoretical and practical aspects of discrete optimization will be introduced using standard software packages such as Lingo and Lindo.

 A second course in materials which expands the philosophy that all materials possess common traits which allow: (1) interchange of classes of materials to perform the same function, e.g., metals, polymers, ceramics, composites, etc.; and (2) understanding of the mechanisms of property controls in new materials. There is an attempt to provide equal representation of the science and the phenomena of engineering materials. Greater emphasis is placed on thermodynamics, stress-strain relations, multicomponent phase equilibria, and such other areas as received minimal exposure in the first course in materials. As a result of present technology trends, more time is spent on composites and achievement of design specifications through synthesis. Graduate standing or special permission. (YR).

This combined lecture and hands on project course aims to train students to optimize the interplay of materials, people, machines and profitability. The course introduces methods to identify product concepts with commercial potential. Student teams will perform market analysis and explore the intellectual property space around their ideas and rapidly iterate them into a final prototype via direct digital manufacturing (e.g., 3D CAD/CAM files manifested via digital printing or machining). Advanced instruction on direct digital manufacturing tools will be given, and customer response will be used as feedback. Early stage prototypes will progress into more sophisticated designs, scaling up (cost, pricing, tooling, process flow and automation) scenario planning for mass manufacturing as well as Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) will be discussed.

 The course will emphasize the similarities between various types of continuous systems as well as common features of continuous and discrete systems. Variational principle will be introduced as a notion of natural modes of vibration for discrete systems is reviewed. Natural modes of vibration for continuous systems will be discussed using the boundary value formulation, the general formulation of the eigenvalue problem and orthogonality. These concepts will be applied to bars, rods, membranes, and plates. Approximate methods will be introduced to determine the natural modes of vibration for complex continuous systems. A few methods to be considered include the Rayleigh-Ritz, Galerkin, Collocation, Myklestad, and Lumped-parameter methods. All the approximate methods presented will allow expedient numerical solution by means of high-speed computers. The damped and undamped response to deterministic excitations will be considered for various systems. Graduate standing or special permission. (YR).

The course will concentrate on a series of films from various European countries with a focus on the socio-political issues, historical events and cultural preoccupations that have defined and also challenged European societies from WWII to the present. Zeroing in on the construction of European identities, the course will analyze and compare modes of narrating national, class, racial, sexual and social differences in different European nations. Themes such as memories of war and the Holocaust, new conflicts, class, immigration, women's rights, gender, and East-West relations will be addressed. The course will thus privilege a cinema that offers a "récit," a story. Particular attention will be given to discourses on otherness and on the ways in which film culture has reflected, reinforced, reshaped and, in some instances, contested Europe's past and current dominant ideologies, and identities. Readings by cultural historians and analysts will provide the context for an understanding of the films. The course will conclude with a discussion of the possible existence of a specific postwar European Cinema.

This course will focus on the position of women in Germany after WWII and up to and after the unification of East and West Germany. Particular attention will be given to the gendered history of working through the National Socialist past, the division and reconstruction of the two nation-states, and the terrorism in West Germany in the 1970's. Students will examine images of women in films and tie them to the ideologies of gender and status of women in these larger issues of German history. Course readings will be in English. Students wishing to receive German credit for the course must enroll concurrently in GER 380: Praktikum. Students cannot receive credit for both MCL 401 and MCL 501.

Full Title: Physical Science and Everyday Thinking 
An inquiry-based physical science course suitable for prospective or practicing elementary teachers majoring or minoring in science studies. Students will construct meaningful understanding of physics and chemistry concepts through discussion, hands-on experiences and computer simulations. Specific topics will include the application of the atomic model to the behavior of gases, physical changes, and chemical changes. A learning-cycle pedagogy will be employed that consists of elicitation of initial student ideas, development of new or modified ideas, building student consensus on final ideas, and the application of ideas to new situations (F, W, S).

The objective of this course is to provide students with an in-depth knowledge of frameworks, policy, and issues that arise in the design and development of new products. In particular, the integration of a development chain with a supply chain forms the basis of knowledge offered in this course. A development chain is the set of activities and processes associated with new product introduction. It includes the product design phase, the associated capabilities and knowledge that need to be developed internally, sourcing decisions, and production plans. Specifically, the development chain includes decisions such as product architecture; what to make internally and what to buy from outside suppliers, that is, make/buy decisions; supplier selection; early supplier involvement; and strategic partnerships. The decisions made in the development chain will have an impact on the supply chain. Similarly, the characteristics of the supply chain must have an impact on the product design strategy and hence on the development chain.

This course is an introduction to Medieval Philosophy and is structured around the ideas and works of key philosophers in the Christian, Islamic and Jewish religious traditions. It attempts to answer the question of what ‘Medieval Philosophy’ is and how it fits into the larger context of the Western philosophical tradition. The course is roughly divided into four sections based on the chronological development of philosophy through the Middle Ages – (I) Early Medieval Christian Philosophy, (II) Islamic Philosophy, (III) Jewish Philosophy and (IV) Latin Christian Philosophy in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries. We will look at what some famous Christian, Muslim and Jewish philosophers, such as Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, Peter Abelard, Al-Ghazali, Ibn Rushd, Saadia, Maimonides, Aquinas, Scotus and Ockham had to say about a diverse range of philosophical issues and topics, including the existence and nature of God, free will, morality, reason and revelation, human nature and the problem of universals.

Darwinism represents a challenge to the traditional view of human life as radically separate from the rest of the natural world. This course will examine the philosophical implications of this world view. It will address questions such as these: Is Darwinism compatible with traditional religion? Does Darwinism imply that human life and the cosmos are without purpose? Can human life be meaningful if it is the result of evolution and natural selection? Does Darwinism require us to change our view of nature? What are the ethical implications of a Darwinian view of life and the universe?

 A philosophical exploration of ethical issues underlying war and peace.  The course will treat such questions as the following: what wars, if any, are just?  Are there moral restrictions on the methods that may be used?  What individuals are morally responsible for wartime decisions, and to what degree?  Discussion of these issues will be used to elucidate larger problems in ethical theory. Students electing this course must have successfully completed a previous course in philosophy or have permission of instructor.

This course will explore the philosophical views of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, examining the interconnections and differences between these two thinkers as well as each one's contributions to philosophy and psychology. The course will focus on both philosophers' emphasis on the individual and how that emphasis arose as a response to the social, political and economic changes in the 19th century and anticipated and influenced philosophical developments in the 20th century, in particular existentialism.

A study of both the history of, and current issues in, the philosophy of technology. This course will examine the deeper meaning and implications of our modern technological society. Questions examined include: What is the definition and nature of technology? How did the concept originate in Western thought? What is the relationship between modern industrial technology and the 'mechanistic' worldview? How do Western religious beliefs influence our attitudes about technology? Is technological progress socially determined, or is it culturally independent? In what ways has our technological society been supportive of, or detrimental to, overall human well-being? Students will cover both classic and contemporary readings.

Feminists working in philosophy, most notably in the 19th and 20th centuries, have altered the traditional philosophical canon by first, recovering women philosophers who were essentially erased from the history and secondly, by extending and contributing to the standard questions of philosophy.  For example, one central question of philosophy; "What can we know with certainty?" has been transformed through a feminist lens and reinterpreted as "What does one's gender, social location, and cultural framework contribute to what one knows?"  In this course we will look at the variety of feminist philosophical theories with a focus on epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics.

Topic Title: Environmental Ethics in the Tropics: This new 2-credit mini-course is designed strictly as a study abroad program, to be conducted on-site at the University of the Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, USVI). It will complement the existing course in Phil 312 (Enviro Ethics), to be held during the same winter semester. Students will exmaine a variety of ethical issues related to environmental damage, climate change, development, tourism, and social trade-offs in a tropical context. There will be an introduction to basic concepts in environmental ethics (intrinsic value, instrumental value, right in nature, eco-pragmatism, etc.), and then these will be examined in light of specific issues in the tropics: rain forest destruction, biodiversity, coral reef health, sea level rise, impact of pollution, impact of develpment, impact of tourism, and so on. The course will be held during scheduled Spring Break of the Winter semester (10 days in total), and will not impact students' other winter term courses.

In this course students will explore the ways that cognitive and affective aspects of social identities (race, gender, socio-economic class, sexual orientation, dis/ability) intersect with issues of social power and privilege to make critical thinking and critical dialogue particularly challenging. We will consider how the history of ‘argument’ in Western philosophy has contributed to the challenges of social identity debates and we will explore a variety cognitive biases and logical fallacies as well as strategies for effectively countering these biases and fallacies.

This course is intended to introduce students to the fundamental elements of the federal budget. During the class we will examine the budgetary process and how it has evolved over time. Contemporary proposals to reform the budget process will be considered as well. Careful attention will also be paid to important components of the federal budget including entitlements, defense spending, and discretionary non-defense spending.

This Primatology Field course will take students through an exploration of the scientific approach and methodology to the study of animal behavior.  Students will gain experience in creating research projects and collecting data on free-ranging animals in a naturalistic environment.  Preparation in lectures and activities on the campus of The University of Michigan-Dearborn will include learning about observational methods in detail, practicing developing ethograms and operational definitions, pilot data collection to modify the ethograms at the Detroit or Toledo Zoo, and use of GPS for data collection.  Lecture materials will also cover topics of primate behavior and ecology. 
Students will spend a week observing a primate species (for example, one possible site for this field course may be to observe free-ranging lemurs at a reserve in Florida).
Student’s data collection at the field site will be for five continuous days.  This field course provides a unique opportunity to study rare and endangered primates species in a safe and accessible environment.  Short day trips to other facilities are possible, such as a visit to an ape sanctuary. 
Topics covered in this field course include advanced observational methods stemming from the field of Ethology, practical development of ethograms (checksheets) and research design, best practices in GPS data collection methods, and collating and summarizing data on animal behavior into a research paper.  Lecture topics will address ethological methods and research design and also how to conduct research with free-ranging nonhuman primates.  In addition there will be a strong focus on health and safety precautions in the field for human and nonhuman primates, acclimation to the field site, and practicalities of data collection.
For graduate credit on this course, extra journal articles and longer written papers required than for the undergraduate requirements.

This Primatology Field course will take students through an exploration of the scientific approach and methodology to the study of animal behavior.  Students will gain experience in creating research projects and collecting data on free-ranging animals in a naturalistic environment.  Preparation in lectures and activities on the campus of The University of Michigan-Dearborn will include learning about observational methods in detail, practicing developing ethograms and operational definitions, pilot data collection to modify the ethograms at the Detroit or Toledo Zoo, and use of GPS for data collection.  Lecture materials will also cover topics of primate behavior and ecology. 
Students will spend a week observing a primate species (for example, one possible site for this field course may be to observe free-ranging lemurs at a reserve in Florida).
Student’s data collection at the field site will be for five continuous days.  This field course provides a unique opportunity to study rare and endangered primates species in a safe and accessible environment.  Short day trips to other facilities are possible, such as a visit to an ape sanctuary. 
Topics covered in this field course include advanced observational methods stemming from the field of Ethology, practical development of ethograms (checksheets) and research design, best practices in GPS data collection methods, and collating and summarizing data on animal behavior into a research paper.  Lecture topics will address ethological methods and research design and also how to conduct research with free-ranging nonhuman primates.  In addition there will be a strong focus on health and safety precautions in the field for human and nonhuman primates, acclimation to the field site, and practicalities of data collection.
For graduate credit on this course, extra journal articles and longer written papers required than for the undergraduate requirements.

This course provides an introduction to the field of psychoneuroimmunology. This area of study is concerned with the multidirectional communication between psychological processes such as stress or depression and central/peripheral nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system functioning. Ultimately, this field seeks to understand the relative contribution of psychological processes to traditional disease states (cardiovascular disease, pregnancy complications, etc). Students will learn the basic functioning of the immune system, and pathways via endocrine and nervous system functioning by which psychological processes influence immune functioning. Finally, students will learn the current state of research examining the relationship between psychological processes and disease outcomes. Students cannot receive credit for both PSYC 590 and PSYC 490.
